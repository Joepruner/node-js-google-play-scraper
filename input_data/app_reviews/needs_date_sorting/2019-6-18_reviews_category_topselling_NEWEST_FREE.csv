Only issue is that sometimes the joints don't want to cooperate with me. For example, I'll try to put the hand on the chest, but it will go through so I'll do it again and it'll glitch out. It's done it 2 times, but I've had it awhile and use it often. Dont let that stop you from getting the app! It's amazing other than that.",

In response to your question: the ease of use and intuitive interface. Not needing to click on multiple things to get to what I want. Also, retaining all the filters I already purchased if I am transferring to Spark Post.   The main issue you are NOT seeing is that many of us used it as a photo editor, not a graphic design app. And this is not what can be done as quickly in Spark (despite the name). With Aviary, one could take a photo, edit it and post it in under 2 minutes. Spark is cumbersome (like all Adobe software), with multiple menus, sub-menus, and sub-sub menus. OK on a laptop. NOT OK for a mobile.",

I will say, THE BLENDING TOOL SUCKS, and the higher quality you try to draw with the more it has some sort of mini-crash where it will take you out of the piece you are working on and put you in your WIP gallery. I would like to have a blending tool brush, that is adjustable, as well as the ability to run higher quality drawings without being kicked out and having to re-enter every 5 to 10 minutes (the crashing may be my phone's fault)",

I think it's stupid that you have to buy any of the main features to actually get any good content from this app. I don't like how slow it runs when you try to zoom in, zoom out, or move it. The app is slow, and I think it could improved greatly. I know you're probably not going to stop and look at my single review, but maybe you could just make minor changes so the app can be better and not dissapoint people. Thank you for at least reading my review.",

The paint bucket only fills in things on the same level and when merging you can't unmerge it. I made a mistake with merging and now i have to redo all the outlines since I didn't realize i put the colour ontop of the outline, i would love to undo it but i can't. I would love to see these things get changed or fixed. Other than that it's a good animation program.",
