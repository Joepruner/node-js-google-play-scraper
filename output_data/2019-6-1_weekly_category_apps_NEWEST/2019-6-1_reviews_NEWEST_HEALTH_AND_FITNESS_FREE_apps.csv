Nothing works. I've gone to a ton of the help forums and followed suggestions there, called Fitbit to talk about connectivity issues, etc. This was a gift for my birthday last June & I haven't been able to really use it for nearly half of the time I've owned it because it won't update. Please fix the firmware update for the Versa ASAP!!"

"Fitbit","Eric Longman","May 14, 2019",1,"Every version of this app seems to add new instability features. At this point it's basically unusable for me. I have restarted my Versa three times, deleted it and reinstalled it on my account, did a factory reset on the watch, reinstalled the app on my phone, turned off WiFi, cycled Bluetooth...everything short of standing on my head and sticking my tongue out. After a Force Quit and a reboot on the phone I might get one good sync out of it, but even that is a crapshoot. Frustrated!"

Syncing takes 5+/- minutes, then one view will have no data listed but another view will include that data; even after it finally syncs, there's often still data missing until you sync again. Worst of all, the feminine health tracking has no way of tracking when a woman is pregnant! How is that not part of a woman's health?! Basically, it feels like a free app, which would be fine if the product it's supporting weren't so expensive."

"Fitbit","Mick Gardner","May 26, 2019",4,"Overall, I like the app, however the latest updates appear to have changed the way that my sleep is monitored and it's so obviously not calculating all of my sleep, whereas in past algorithms it had done so. For example, I've been taking naps more frequently during the day and prior to the last two updates the app had added that time into my daily sleep tally separately. It no longer adds it at all now. Refreshing of all stats also is taking somewhat longer, but that is just very minor."
"Fitbit","Rayanne M. Buchianico","May 26, 2019",4,"I'm not super active, I use fitbit to track steps, exercise, and sleep. this does a pretty good job of those. Occasionally, I'll check into my heart rate. During the day, it tracks the number of hours where I walked 250 steps or more. But by the next day, my history is gone. this started a few months back. I keep hoping the next update will fix it, but it never does. Beyond that, the app does what it's supposed to do."

I have never rooted my phone. I emailed and got a reply, that's nice, recommending uninstall and reinstall (didn't fix it) and to check if my system was rooted. Somehow after multiple reinstalls and reboots it works.. but how reliable will it be?"

If you could somehow curb the obvious cheaters, I think it would give people more insensitive to join the challenges."

Tried unpairing and repairing, uninstalled the app and reinstalled, restarted my phone and still nothing. several times when trying to re-pair the devices, it will say ""found it!"" then I get an error message saying ""not found"" and to either cancel or ""restart bluetooth"" and neither option corrects issue."

"Fitbit","Cynthia Kneipp","May 24, 2019",4,"Love my fitbit but the app just needs a couple things to really set it off. One annoying feature is that the calories in and out don't correlate on the dashboard properly. The dashboard might say that I have 200 cals left, but when I open it, it says I'm over my budget. it would be great if the dashboard reflected my budget properly because at the moment it's pointless. Also it would be great to see what your weekly macronutiants break down is instead of just daily. So a total for the week."

Bought a Charge 3 for myself and my wife to use with a Motorola E4 plus, hers set up mine would not.   I called them and danced around for about an hour until the lady said it was not compatible with the Motorola E 4 (this was before we tried my wife's) buy I was able to see the time and steps and resigned myself to that use.  Just for kicks we tired to set up my wife's and wala it worked but mine still would not. I lived with it until I traveled and found out it would not change time zones.   I called them again and after another hour of play was told again it would not work so I asked it I could use my laptop to set it up and the answer was yes, but it too would not set up so that said it was not a cell phone problem but a fitbit problem at which time she said because we uninstalled the app and reinstalled that was causing the problem which they are working on and to call back in a week??????????  However, in the hour process she had me restart the fitbit which I now discovered set the watch to 12 am and there it sits.. so now I only have a step counter"

One suggestion for developers that in Sleep Timing, there should be options of recording sleep timing more than once a day. It means if a person has to take sleep in parts (due to any reason), he should still be able to record his hours of sleep during the day. It will benefit a lot of people who have this experience."

There is no way to edit that. You either erase the workout and don't have it or leave it there wrong. Also it doesn't give the option of add new activities that are not part of the app. So I have uninstalled it and use Google Fit instead."

On top of ad every time you add a drink, you get ads with the notification. The notification with the ad breaks full screen videos and stops them. So if you're watching a live stream or videos, the notification will ruin it and throw you ads on top of it. Edit: so last night I had 2600/2630 ml, I got between 60-80% completed. Today, before drinking anything, 1200 ml."

"Fitbit","gordon kalamasz","May 19, 2019",1,"So sorry to give such a bad review. but I do hope this helps someone else. This is my second ionic. The first one stop working and the screen kept flashing. I was grateful Fitbit did replace. I was surprised they only sent me the Fitbit not new bands. I thought that was kind of weird. For the price we paid. Now I am constantly having problems syncing my device. I am getting messages saying my tracker is not responding. I imagine if I called the company  they may send me another one  but truthfully  after the third one  I don't want to see Fitbit anymore .  There are so many devices that do the same thing  cheaper faster better . I am also let down bye the size of the ionic and limited number of features, and exceptionally limited number of apps. Battery life is terrible I need to charge it most days. Sort of like Fitbit was trying to make the ionic look  like  and Apple watch. Surprise. I'm done with Fitbit."

If you drink 14 oz you have to tap the button twice so you have to watch an ad twice. Nope. Uninstalling.  Replying to below comment. It's the frequency of ads and the fact that they all make a bunch of noise. I don't want to have to silence my phone every time I click on an app because every 2 seconds some game music is going to start blaring. It's obnoxious. I have a lot of free apps and none of them have an ad every time you click a button in the app. That's ridiculous."

The only downside is that I am not able to include any more than 100 foods that I eat and I then need to choose something similar in calories. A great app!!!

Won’t charge, won’t turn on and apparently, this is a regular occurrence with these watches and about the only people on earth that don’t know this, are the employees at Samsung.  I would go for a run and after 45 minutes the watch would report my BPM at 220. Stop, wipe off the watch and bam, back to 140.  Turns out, if you sweat when you work out, the watch doesn’t work. Get a call and the watch goes into a different display mode and you have to literally stop and reset the damned watch to display/track your progress. Then there’s this stupid NOTICE: after the watch figures out you have been exercising for 10 minutes, it displays a message and tries to force you to go into the settings and set the automatic sensor for workouts. Problem is: the automatic workout senor was already on and you cannot simply push a single button and get your workout data back. This app and watch just suck"

After several phone calls with Samsung I ended up getting a new S10. To my surprise the same thing happened again. What I ended up figuring out is another app I use, My BP Lab (also associated with Samsung) was causing Samsung health to not work correctly. As long as you didn't use My BP Lab the health app worked correctly but if you used it once then the health app was messed up until you restarted the phone. Due to the connection between these two apps I would think that they should be able to work together."

I wish this app had a barcode to scan food, and spot to make your own recipes so you know the exact calories. it's just a pain tracking calories without these two things. everything else is ok.

"Fitbit","Skipped Stitches","May 31, 2019",1,"Total rubbish! The app is utterly useless.  1. Poorly designed interface. When launching the app for the first time, you are asked whether you wish to log in or create an account. If you choose to create a new account, the subsequent screen looks like a log-in screen requesting your email and password. There is no option to re-enter the password to ensure you typed it correctly both times.  2. Progressing past this screen, you select the Fitbit model you have, and try to pair it with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. The app says the screen of your Fitbit must be on, yet the app detects the FitBit without the screen being on. Pointless instruction.  3. This is the issue that  wipes out any possibility of this being a 2 or 3 star app. After entering the pairing code, the app simply cannot connect to my Fitbit. It tries, reports that the setup routine is taking longer than normal, and keeps trying. And trying. And trying. And trying. But no connection is ever made.  Essentially, all I have on my wrist is an over-priced pedometer. I cannot track any of my workouts, my sleep, or view any statistics."

I generally do two workouts a day, and it is only crediting one.  Now not really a big deal, since it is there in steps, and time, but I use that section to help me identify how hard I am working out.  Ideas?"

Charge Your Inspire page doesn't say what to plug the charging cable into.  Sure won't be my phone as it doesn't have a full size USB plug.  Ah, the next page says it, but then is searching for the Inspire HR that isn't plugged into the phone.  After retrying the search a couple of times it says that Bluetooth might not be turned on.  Was it searching for Bluetooth?  My phone found the Inspire HR but failed to pair with it.  Many times.    My laptop has a USB plug so I tried to run the App on my Windows 10 laptop.

"Samsung Health","Ziggie Zag","May 3, 2019",1,"The app is HUGE & requires many other apps, more storage & permissioms I am not comfortable with. There is NO history!!! that makes it impossible to compare data & if I don't catch it before midnight, I don't even know what my final numbers were. A BIG problem for us 3rd shifters. Anyone know of a better app? I love the band, but the limitations of the app will make it impossible to keep."

I only wish that for the sleep recording function (it records the time you go to bed & what time you wake up) can record multiple sleep periods for those of us with insomnia (I.E: I slept from 12 a.m. - 4 a.m., was up between 4 a.m.to 5:30 a.m. & slept again from 5:30 a.m. - 11 a.m.). And not only should it record multiple sleep periods, but also provide links to better sleeping tips, etc. Other than that, I love this app. Also records caloric intake, blood pressure, weight."

I'm in a wheelchair and I've never taken a step a single day of my life so you can imagine my surprise when I took 11 steps yesterday morning. I was up to 306/5000 by the end of the day. A personal best! Please change this setting. The joke got old by the end of the day and it irritated me that I couldn't turn it off. Otherwise an excellent app for health management (a major part of my daily routine)."

I may eventually get another. I like the size of the Charge 2 so I may just get the 3 instead of the ALTA... looks too big for my small wrists. Hope you get one too!"

"Fitbit","Kelvin Lloyd Aranilla","May 30, 2019",3,"With Fitbit being second to none in fitness tracking, it's surprising that my phone with Google Fit is a better step counter. I went to Fitbit because of sleep traking. I also like the real-time HR monitor. Everything else, though, isn't so good. For one, the step counter overcounts if you're a normal person who has to go to work. On the other hand, Google Fit only counts steps when it detects actual movement that humans make and can make via GPS. I expected Fitbit to do this too, disappointing."

"Fitbit","Lindie Sehmel","May 17, 2019",1,"Love the inpsire hr and the idea of it working with the app for health insights but am DISAPPOINTED. Smart tracking only works sometimes and mannually inputting items in the app is still a pain as you cannot use decimals and need to round values, meaning inaccuracy which is useless when tracking. Also no option of editing manual excersizes, need to delete everything and start adding ALL OVER AGAIN. And all day syncing also giving problems, need to mannually sync most of the time."

I recently purchased the Versa and can honestly say its a sorry excuse for a smart watch. Even after doing all the troubleshooting Fitbit suggests it still is completely inaccurate with steps and distance ran. Their excuse is now objects like trees, houses, and cars could interfere with the connection causing it to be less accurate....even though I run at the beach with nothing around!"

But now the app has suddenly stopped synching with Strava even though Strava displays as one of my partner apps. Also, I record my sleep in the app every day but the weekly report the app generates says there's no sleep data recorded."

It actually has potential but it is marred by the tacky inclusion of rotating advertisements which sit at the top of the screen. you cannot disable the advertisements. this seems beneath such an app for such a company. it really dissuades my use of the app and therefore it gets a much lower rating. for this reason I use my Garmin watch with Garmin connect much more now. Please, simply remove unwanted advertisements from apps that are part of the core of Samsung."

There's also an option in the app which allows you to send a request to the app developers asking them to add missing food or meals, I have made so many requests, and again, they bever cared to respond.

Once the reminder shows on screen, later moves the notification away but drink option should not open the app and record. It should record without the need to open the app. It becomes too intrusive to the activity one is doing. This way one is reminded, and one can log drinking water without the need to context switch on phone to the app. This is quite annoying, kindly fix this. Still my goto app for water intake."

Hard to compare hours of sleep for each day when they all get changed. Very frustrating. I have a Blaze if that makes a difference."

Fitbit also has very detailed sleep stats. My watch stopped counting steps yesterday. Then today it said I was active between 12am-3am and counted a lot of steps. My watch was on the charger at that time! There's no way to edit it."

My Charge 2 connects to my phone (Samsung S7) and records distance, pace and elevation.  However, on the map in the app it does not display a route, just a single point, which is neither the start nor end point.  If I save the map as a tcx file and open in a text editor the figures for latitude and longitude are the same for every entry. Example can be supplied.  The GPS on my phone is working correctly - checked by another GPS app and if I start another fitness app (Runkeeper), it records the activity and maps the route correctly.  Hopefully the next update will solve this problem"

Sometimes it will try to show an additional message, like ""This food has lots of Vitamin C"". 4. As I reach for the button to add another food, that additional message appears after a brief delay, and instead of hitting the ""Add food"" button, I hit the food I just added and it takes me to the page to edit that food.  That additional message doesn't always appear, so the result is a change to the interface that moves the button I am trying to hit. Worse, that change is unpredictable and inconsistent. After adding a food, the logical next step is to add another food item, so don't move that button. Please fix this!"

Retried with a different mail id and it finally worked. Its a damn cool app that works perfectly well with no glitches. I would definitely suggest a keto option of sorts. For example, I am in ketosis now and use coconut oil to cook most of my meals. I am unable to calculate calories/fat in food cooked with coconut oil as its not readily available on the database."

One problem is that if i change weight, +200 pounds just to see what happens, there is a delay in changing the daily calorie goal (like 10 minutes later). This is an extremely helpful, and safe app! One thing I would recommend is giving new users a short guide to weighing themselves, choose the same point everyday, only compare weekly averages, period bloating, etc."

I don't feel restricted in what I eat but I believe that the process of recording has a powerful controlling effect on any extreme excess. I don't know how it compares to other calorie counting apps because it is the only one I have ever needed. I believe the best approach is to record everything as accurately as you can and not worry too much about staying within your limits."

Importantly, it connects to Strava and the mapmyfitness apps, so I can keep an accurate record of calories burned cycling and walking. However, I have noticed since 2017-8 that it is becoming increasingly slow, probably due to increasing prevalence of ads in the app. It frequently launches the Google Now Launcher in the background, and I have to kill the application.

"Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal","A Google User","May 22, 2019",3,"The app is good overall, however a little frustrating in the sense that a lot of foods are missing their nutritional info e.g. fibre. All food entered should be forced to be entered as grams or mls, since this is on the nutritional tables. It is a calorie counting tool and cups or 1 small does not help that, then you end up having to create an entry as you want to enter the weight."

HR tech or useless."

That means I must go back and make each entry a half portion. This is great if you eat out often or eat prepared food, but entering a homemade item, such as a tomato sandwich is annoying when you have to enter each ingredient separately."
