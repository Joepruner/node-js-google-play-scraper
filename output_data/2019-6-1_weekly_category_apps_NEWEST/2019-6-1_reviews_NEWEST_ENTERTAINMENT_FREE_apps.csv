I have been experiencing issues with Chrome Cast in general lately but on YT Kids the icon doesn't even appear, but it's there on other cast enabled apps including YouTube. The main reason we started using the app was to cast shows to a TV with a Chromecast attached. The app is kinda useless now...have to use regular YouTube to find kids videos when needing to cast.

We can teach other dialects to our children faster than the world tour here. If we want to select Latin so they can pick up root words without our help or some Pink Fong that's great. At their level I don't want to speak a sentence in 3 languages then explain the base of certain words every day. Would just like a single language conversation at this moment."

"Tubi - Free Movies & TV Shows","Jonah Lange","May 29, 2019",3,"The app seems to be fine, ads in all if you're prepared for it. What my review is mostly on here is the content. As I went through it all seemed to be mostly unfamiliar and mostly R-rated titles (save the family section). There is a high-rated section in which I found a few more familiar titles. Assuming Tubi is fairly new, if they work on putting in more good, familiar titles, then this may eventually be a good substitute for Netflix, but, expectedly, Netflix currently has more to offer."

Otherwise it's great & is alot of fun 👍🏻good job guys 😁"

When I select one, it SETS it as my selected DEFAULT app! I then cannot access the other option unless I go to my Settings & CLEAR my Default App. This is getting very annoying to have to repeatedly clear my Default app! Why in the attachment options is it not available unless I select attach image?"

Also app really needs a in app lock screen/lock buttons option for phones and tablets don't don't have a alternative option.

"YouTube Kids","Sarah Davis","April 18, 2019",2,"Edit update: Chrome cast doesn't work as of now, so there is no way to safely monitor videos and there has been a surge in disturbing content. -The app doesn't keep track of videos when casting which leads to issues when you can't track down inappropriate videos that need to be restricted. -The restricted feature doesn't always work or keep track of it for long - the load screen takes too long and comes up every time the app closes. -You can't select certain videos or channels you prefer to be visible for your child so it's completely random what they tend to get."

I have encountered a few channels/videos that I felt were not very suitable for my son to watch. But even when that happens I found that it was easy to block the video/channel to prevent him from accessing it. I would say that, as long as you're a parent that keeps track of what your child watches, you should give this app a try for yourself!"

And we can take care of the body and makeup and accessories and stuff but i think our bitmoji should look like us and well, its a tiny nit5 difficult do it with what we have now in the app. So if u guys like the idea, I'll look forward for the update.

There's an option to select videos manually, but a parent is limited too - some videos just don't appear if you search for them (e.g. a bunny taking cookie from a baby - innocent and funny, but does't show up). While creating a profile for your kid you select an age and that doesn't seem to affect anything. My 2 y.o. was able to block his favorite video and finally flag it. No password was required. He cried for it, but it was gone for good."

"YouTube Kids","Mike Watson","April 15, 2019",1,"This app is absolute garbage. Most of the content is brain-rotting music videos and kids TV with no ability to add any serious educational content. I was hoping to set this up so I could whitelist specific educational videos (electronics, nature documentaries, etc).   I want to be able to find a cool Origami folding instructions video for my 6 year old or a breadboard circuit video for my 8 year old and let them watch it on their own devices. Unfortunately I can't do that because the ""curated"" content of YouTube kids does not allow parents to whitelist videos from YouTube and limits children to only watch garbage.  This app frustrates me because it only focuses on the addictive entertainment aspect of YouTube while completely ignoring all the high-quality science, art and math content that can literally change a child's life. There are so many educators that share so much content on YouTube and you limit kids to stupid Kidzbop videos? Shame on you Google."

I do not know if there is a way to create a bitmoji for someone else, like your significant other, and then create scenes but I have not found it if that is the case. it is pretty much a 5-star rating but I gave it a for because I like the option to interact with other people and create a multi-person bitmoji."

I just think the male and female options should be together, instead of separate. I hate the all girls outfits, because it doesn't make my bitmoji look like me. I know its silly but it just annoys me."

It was ""alright"" until ya'll serioisly got rid of everything. The music is trash, the videos are so babyish and stupid, and there isn't ANYTHING a teenager would like. Ya'll should really think about the teenagers that aren't allowed to watch regular YouTube. The older kids setting is trash no 12 year olds even watch that stupid stuff 😒."

For instance: you can't put makeup on a male bitmoji and you can't put ""male outfits"" on female bitmojis and vise versa. This is a problem because it enforces a gender standard and ignores gender non-conforming folks like myself. The solution is to have gender customization options which would include defining body type and clothing preferences separately. (I'd be happy to talk to a dev!)"

They don't care what their users want.. they just want an audience to force their products on. The really important search criteria doesn't exist.

They each have their own profile to keep their content separate which is nice too. A really cool touch is the fun UI they've created as well."

"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","A Google User","March 26, 2019",2,"If you pay extra for the commercial skip and DVR it is not bad, but live TV is horrible.  If you want to watch something that is being recorded it makes it extremely difficult to start from the beginning and does not allow you to skip commercials even when you have enough buffer to skip through them.  Also, while a commercial is playing it won't let you restart or rewind.  Can't sort the DRV, everything appears in random order.  No programming guide.  Too many other basic features that it should have, but doesn't.  It's like the designers have never heard of Tivo.  Update.  I kept waiting for the service to get better, it got much worse.  I was paying extra for no commercials and everything had commercials, no skip, no fast forward.  I went with another service."

I don't understand why just because you are making your app better you need to no longer support older devices. Netflix does the same function, allowing you to stream shows and he can still use that app on his device. his tablet isn't even that old and is in perfect condition. shame. needs fix. app sucks for this"

I just watched a 22 minute anime that had 6 ads! The ad-free option for $11.99 and the ad-free bundle for $50.99 say in the small print that some videos will have ads at the beginning and end of the video! That's alot of money to spend on an app that is also making money from ads! Sux!"

Then they snuck the ads back in there. Now we have to pay more to get rid of the ads. Oh, and now you have to pay for more features if you want to watch on more than one screen at a time. (2019)"

what was airing on the networks offered. I live in a major city, close to 
90 over the air towers but with HULU it failed to deliver local networks 
and networks like AMC, FX, TBS, MTV etc. The format is very user friendly, 
pricing is competitive, it casts great. I'd certainly chose HULU as my main

But I am dissatisfied with the categories available in overall sections (movies, tv, kids, etc). The problem I have, that I'd wish you'd resolve, is that there's no A-Z (alphabetical) option. Sometimes I have the desire to look at your ENTIRE catalogue. And had the option been made available, I would rather utilize that than scanning every other option available. Including, but not limited to, Staff Picks!? (Most are actually quite good) but no A-Z? Why?"

The navigation system is easy to use, and its very fast and easy to pick content, while also making sure not to overload you with choices. My only major problem is that Hulu's implementation of scrubbing causes it to falsely think you are scrubbing when your fingers are on the edge of the screen. It also assumes your screen is 16:9, meaning widescreen content can take advantage of 18:9"

You may have to go to different apps to see the rest of your show, or you might not be able to find it at all. Just please if you are going to put a show on here, please put the whole show on here."
"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","April Kruger","April 28, 2019",4,"Here is my most recent review. I really like Hulu but i wish there were a couple more options. It would be great to shut off auto play. I dislike it automatically playing a new series when I reach the end of what I am watching. I also wish there was something like a timer in place for if you accidentally exit out or just touch the screen, (on a touch screen). Every time this happens, I have to rewatch the commercials. It also tend to forget my place, making me search for where I left off."

"Netflix","F Stanton","May 26, 2019",2,"I would call this latest upgrade more of a downgrade. As many have noted, you now have to choose a user each and every time, instead of continuing with the last user. More irritating to me is that the Cast button comes and goes. Most of the time I can't find it on whatever page I'm on. Sometimes it's on the Home page, sometimes not. Netflix is a very good service, but they need to hire an app developer who tests their UI design on real people rather than in-house people who already know the app."

It was annoying when I'd have to select the one profile every so often, for no reason, but at least it only asked me once. Now it's infuriating when it asks every time I open the app. For no reason I had to log into my account on my ps4 again, then it asked me who was watching. It only asked that one time.

What bothers me is the app refues to keep track of what part I left off on. Jumping from season to season or starting a title completely over. It even gies so far as to say Ive never even watched the title. its only been doing this since the recent update. I might as well just watch the shows on cable TV if I can't pick up from where I left off."

"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","Christopher A Kelsey","April 19, 2019",2,"1.5minutes of ads every 5mins~ I can get premium game content for ""free"" for less ad time the that. I can go to Vudu or TuBi tv and watch less ads. Beyond the hold on the marvel content, Hulu isn't worth it imho. wont be reupping. Not when i pay $6+ and then pay with ad viewing that is more then live tv. Greed is excessive."

If your phone and Roku aren't on the same SID, the app no longer finds it and prevents you from reaching the screen to manually connect.

It doesn't allow you to change volume. The keyboard only works in Amazon Prime. It works--and you have to use it because the regular remote is programmed to die every 30 days no matter how little"

Honestly the swiping is so irritating, but whatever I can deal with it. What I can't deal with, however, is that it registers that you pushed select MAYBE *half* the time. Really need to order a new remote. This update is horrible. Painfully slow and I have to reconnect and restart it constantly. If I hadn't lost my remote I would delete it.

"Roku","nonstopfox","May 29, 2019",3,"It works well except for the fact you have to connect to your Roku each time you look away from your phone (no joke, it happens that often). I don't know why they haven't enabled some kind of persistent connection. I could understand needing to connect each time you launch the app but it should stay connected as long as the app is open. That issue and the default page being a list of featured apps instead of the remote makes it feel more like a way to advertise to you as opposed to a remote."

Two problems; no ratings on the movies and the fact that many have dark themes. Today's world is hard enough. I like movies that deliver a message about doing good works, even if methodology is questionable. Also love a great plot and some form of comedy/tongue in cheek humor. There is plenty of nastiness in today's society and not enough of the moral message that used to be part of most films. Buffering still annoying."

It doesn't always keep track of shows you actually like to watch. If you click on a show and decide you really don't like it in the first few minutes, there's no way to take it off your keep watching list. Hulu AI then suggest shows for you that you really, really don't like. The only upside is if Hulu is part of big brother, then big brother really doesn't know who you are."

There are plenty of popular cartoon series from that period (also 90s and up) as well as tv shows that are good, clean fun, unlike today. Streaming is seamless and everything is well organized, plus it keeps track of where you left off on all your shows. The movie selection leaves a bit to be desired. Perhaps add a Tubi+ option for a small monthly fee (with ads, like Hulu) for better movies."

No remote locator, no headphone jack, ir works terrible, no voice search, why? it's newer than roku4. i was hoping this app may be the better option, but it is not. my advice, but a regular tv, and a roku 4. looks like multiple remotes are never going away."

You can scroll through Roku titles in the app, then launch them directly onto your TV without having to scroll and click with the remote (which is frustratingly slow on my device). Hopefully in the next update, the remote feature will stay connected while a movie is playing so you can pause quickly when needed. Also, would like to be able to cast Netflix titles directly to the TV. Maybe in a future update? Overall, highly recommend!"

If you can be a little patient, most shows and news stations broadcast the live show/news a few hours later, and always by the the following day. I cannot advise you about live sports events, since I only watch Pro football and I didn't watch last season. I fully, and whole hearttedly recomend Hulu."

Its webseries shows Indias Native Faith and Culture only in negative light - spreading discord and misinformation. They wouldnt dare do it for any other Faith / Culture as backlash would be huge, Indians till now have accepted all the ignominy heaped on them. But No More, I have uninstalled Netflix and advise other Indians with self respect to do the same. there are other options."

You get to pick outfits and design your character in any way. You can play around with friends too. I Suggestion I think should happen is instead of just being one whole out there should be different sections for pants only, dresses only, shirts only, and etc. I also think that there should be new and more clothing that could relate to what's in style."

Ty Tubi team. also....its free....unlike cable...which you spend money on and still get swamped by ads"

However, the did have some good old shows and movies, like Heathers, but they definitely need an update, if they want people to use their app more then Netflix but until this app gets that change I will be watching American Horror story on Netflix."

"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","Roseli Ferrer","April 8, 2019",5,"Absolutely NO commercials better and newer movies then Netflix. Many people writing about advertisements but you have the CHOICE of what you want. People need to read all their options first before selecting. Yes, the option without ads is more expensive but, believe me for few bucks more, I choose that anyday. And is still less then $15 a month. Why not. Cable is way higher. And from all the channels you pay you probably only watch top 3 channels any way and yes many more ads."

"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","Miguel Ramirez","May 7, 2019",3,"This app is pretty good, although I have 3 suggestions. My main suggestion is to fix video loading. For some reason every time you open the app, playback is extremely slow especially when compared to literally anything else. Additionally, a pop-up window would be nice. Finally, the ""Fit to screen"" button is really confusing. Please add this so the settings so that I can have the ability to always set it to that mode. I will be glad to raise my rating when these changes are made bc hulu is best!"
"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","Information and Ideas","May 7, 2019",1,"please read all. I can almost guarantee you will agree. hulu costs more then all other apps and it has commercials and no downloading function unlike every other app a lot of shows without the first couple seasons the second movie but never the first and it uses more data and screws up more than any other app even when It has more bars. i think it is way to greedy for what it offers. i dont care for netflix either but netflix is cheaper with no commercials and you can download and watch offline."

Why it is not possible to just press a record button (like an old vcr)?  It is incredibly frustrating especially with sporting events that run late. Even if you know it is running late, HULU will simply not allow you to record the following program or extend the recording (pretty much the most basic of DVR settings)."

If I connect to my phone so I can control the roku, after watching for like five minutes it will disconnect and you start over. Even worse, when you connect the screen goes back to the first menu witch is pretty pointless. Fix the remote!!!"
"Roku","Scott M","June 1, 2019",1,"Gets worse with every release. Constant disconnections or having the app crash. version 4.2.8.3 worked perfect, but these later versions are so buggy. Remote sound through the app no longer works, adding the widget to homescreen is pointless as it can't be used as a quick remote as the app needs to be relaunched everytime you wake the phone up. Have emailed roku support on numerous occasions, but as usual they don't respond to UK customers."

"Roku","Espi Schaefer","April 28, 2019",1,"The remote takes forever to get to and get working. There is no longer the pure remote in the center. It is now four white thin arrows that you have to slide your finger on to get working, which means most of the time you swipe past what you want. The center ""OK"" button is no longer there. It has been replaced with a sentence that says something like ""Tap here"" but longer. You have to tap around that general area a few times+ before the remote will click on what you want. This is ridiculous."

My new complaint is, that I have to sign in every time. it turns off after a few minutes and I had to sign in several times while watching TV. I really like this app. I use it more than the remote. I like that it's quite responsive. You can switch between devices. And the headphone feature. But I find the audio feature buggy.

All I want is a remote control to pause and adjust the volume on my TV without having to see the ""featured ads"" screen, a ""searching for device..."" screen (the IP hasn't changed in 2 years, just send the command!), and the ad screen *again* after it finds the device. Also, the 20 second load time is a bit much. Split the app off into a Lite version and I'd be happy."

I'm happy to pay upto £10 but I'm not willing to pay more. You need to update your plans to add 4K for an extra £1. My idea would be HD and 1 stream would be £5.99 and £7.99 for 2 streams and £11 for 4 streams. my idea gives consumers choice and flexible plus when Disney+ comes this year you'll need to be more competitive."

One last thong is they should start to do something like you can save a movie or show and keep it there. Or if you don't like a show you can like hold it down and delete it from there and you can ask or request a movie or show you want back or a new one."

The cast button on the screen is missing but SOMETIMES appears when you start a video; it casts to the TV, but you cannot control the playback. No way to stop, pause, advance. Please fix. I tried all of the troubleshooting directions on the Netflix website and nothing fixed the streaming issue. The app on my Samsung phone works fine, so this tablet issue can be corrected."

Everytime i called they would so called Fix the issue yet still Overdrafted my Account. I only tried this because most of my family used Hulu. Not anymore Im going back to Sling at least they gave me My Free Trail and Netflex is Much better .... I dont have to worry about these issues. Its NOT worth it.

Every time you open it a full screen popup ad plays that you have to close out of... like is this for real? This is a real app by Amazon? They also fully block Chromecast so i can't watch videos on my tv. Both of these issues could be fixed really easily, but they won't do it. They don't care about user experience at all, they only care about advertising their original programming and trying to make the fire stick (lol) beat Chromecast."

Screen mirroring is brutal on my phone and often choppy. I assumed Amazon would jump on the bandwagon and at least offer the popular alternative to cast media, but nope. There's disappointing lack of features or options. Itd be nice to pay a reduced fee for prime, since I don't bother using the video app."

"Hulu: Stream TV, Movies & more","Isaac C","April 24, 2019",2,"Hulu Live has so many glitches I probably cannot address them all in this review. One of them is it will jump back about 5 minutes from the live cast. Then you have to fast forward to the live cast or back out and come back to the show. It does this often. Also the format for recording is not user friendly. If you add favorite show it will automatically record everything. If you record one episode it will force you to add it to My Stuff. Not enough room for me to explain further my distaste."
