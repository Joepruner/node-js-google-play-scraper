Bottom Line: I would recommend this learning tool as it is free and definitely useful.

They do however, often pop ads for their ""Duolingo Plus"" meaning extra benefits. It says 5 min a day, but in reality of you want to learn a language in under 5 yrs you should spend 20"

English may not have an official plural of ""you,"" but ""y'all"" and ""you all"" are acceptable substitutes- the singular ""you"" only leads to confusion. It also chooses a lot of less used words instead of the most common form. That is not optimal for new language learners. Finally, this app has a terrible habit of quizzing on vocabulary it has not taught you yet, without the helpful pictures. Use as a supplement only."

The only way to know what a word means is by testing out the tests. In danish, there was no page about what you were about to learn so if you don't come back for a long time and forget phrases. you would have to guess the tests along the way. the starts are usually easy because the tests basically give you the answer. which makes people not really learn well."

It's fun to learn with this app, yea. However, I would like to say that practicing isn't so good. I go through a part, learn some new words, but the only way I can practice them again is if those words come up in a later part, or if I do the part over again, and I don't want to spend that much time re-learning something I already know. The practice button usually brings me back to the basics."

Some languages require more focus on sounds & meaning as they don't use Roman script. They can't compete with European languages.

I go through a part, learn some new words, but the only way I can practice them again is if those words come up in a later part, or if I do the part over again, and I don't want to spend that much time re-learning something I already know.

I'm also using a workbook and the app that goes along with it for added help. the reason for that is bcuz this app doesn't get into why and how to conjugate the nouns and what articles go with them."

Duolingo is consistantly the best in terms of number of languages (which continues to grow at a respectable rate), accuracy (not perfect), and teachability. It's a fun first step to learning a language, but it will not make you fluent. Read books and articles and speak with native speakers if you're serious. Recent update made me have to start over in every language."

The other day, I was able to read a Japanese word on Twitter, because this app made me familiar with the hiragana used. It doesn't seem like much, but I felt like it was a pretty big accomplishment!"

This app hasn't necessarily taught me anything about grammar or seems to ever get to that point no matter how many times I level up. I keep waiting and pushing through levels to get past ( I drink,he drinks,you drink) but all it does is teach very basic words which limits progress for intermediate learners."

I had never downloaded the app before so l definetly hadn't made an account before. I tried a few more times but the same thing kept on happening. Its the first time l downloaded the app and also the last time too. Seriously don't download this app."

A toilet is not a restroom or a bathroom unless the specific word/phrase for bathroom is used in the other language. 'Football Am√©ricain' is not 'Football'. It literally means 'American Football'."

My only frustration is the amount of repetition. Even though I take quizzes and it says it is making it harder for me, I'm not noticing much of a difference. For someone who is new to the language, however, I think that would be a benefit."

Kudos for teaching some endangered languages as well (might I suggest adding Sami in the future?) However, there are some flaws. Some grammar rules aren't explained in the materials provided. At least that's what I found while learning Japanese. Also, there's really not much use for lingots apart from some sick skins. Overall, I would still recommend duolingo as a tool."

I noticed a trend where people start to use this app relatively less the deeper they go in a language. At earlier levels you even gain more xp in general, through tests and such. So on the leader boards, all the top people have very low overall xp. I use this app consistently everyday but I won't spend 2 hours everyday on it just to 'climb' so it is such a pointless feature, and there is no socializing aspect"

"Duolingo: Learn Languages Free","Christopher Moore","May 25, 2019",3,"I like the easiness and accessibility of Duolingo, but it bothers me that they don't have any dictionary of the terms you've learned. Also, they don't tell you rules for lenition or how words change; you have to just look really closely and try to figure it out by yourself (which will not necessarily be correct). Also, they don't teach you foreign alphabets. Beside that, I love that they have so many languages, and I do use Duolingo often, I just wouldn't recommend you use only Duolingo."

Charges (for 1 year) were some R1241. 86 all inclusive, debited upfront. That's just a rip off for an online language course. The meager benefits of Plus (paid subscription) compared with free subscription just don't justify the expense.

Three years of study with him and I could say ""I'm tired"" and ""I'm hungry"" but not much else. That soured me on continuing language in college. Along comes Duolingo and in a few short months I'm way ahead of where I was after three years in high school...in fact, I'm actually learning how to speak a new language. I already have my next one picked out. I highly recommend Duolingo."

"Duolingo: Learn Languages Free","A Google User","May 28, 2019",1,"I used to love it, but then they got rid of groups (no encouragement, no sharing learning resources, less help) & added leaderboards for all languages combined. Some languages require more focus on sounds & meaning as they don't use Roman script. They can't compete with European languages. Learning too fast or too much doesn't let you absorb the lessons. for some languages you'll find yourself sacrificing sounds for meanings or even meaning itself & passing by ""remembering"" the sentence."

The concept of the leader boards and maintaining a study streak really has motivated me. My only dislike is that they recently added the requirement of spending 5 lingots (in game currency) to test out of lessons. The alternative is buying the Plus membership. But I won't fault them majorly for that. Overall I would recommend it for beginning to learn a language, I can't speak for obtaining fluency yet ."

Probably best for those with some familiarity with the language.Some translations are a bit ""iffy"", but still a great app. Love the format and the fact that you can REALLY get all the content free if you are willing to see ads."

I'm using this app to learn Korean but I'll probably only use it for learning the alphabet and maybe vocab since that's where flashcards are effective."

Duo does everything to make me stay in the app all day and introduced leagues and tops for this. In old Duo i could study all day only because i enjoyed the process of learning, i felt that i really learn language. I don't like that i can't ""short cut"" out of skills without paying 5 lingots. I feel i am just wasting my time. There should be option to choose old version."

"Duolingo: Learn Languages Free","A Google User","May 28, 2019",1,"I used to love it, but then they got rid of groups (no encouragement, no sharing learning resources, less help) & added leaderboards for all languages combined. Some languages require more focus on sounds & meaning as they don't use Roman script. They can't compete with European languages. Learning too fast or too much doesn't let you absorb the lessons. for some languages you'll find yourself sacrificing sounds for meanings or even meaning itself & passing by ""remembering"" the sentence."
"Duolingo: Learn Languages Free","melco S.","May 28, 2019",4,"It's fun, it's free, and I think it's made a positive difference in my life. The concept of the leader boards and maintaining a study streak really has motivated me. My only dislike is that they recently added the requirement of spending 5 lingots (in game currency) to test out of lessons. The alternative is buying the Plus membership. But I won't fault them majorly for that. Overall I would recommend it for beginning to learn a language, I can't speak for obtaining fluency yet ."

Not only this but there are certain errors that have appeared that, once flagged, nothing comes of it."

Duolingo is consistantly the best in terms of number of languages (which continues to grow at a respectable rate), accuracy (not perfect), and teachability. It's a fun first step to learning a language, but it will not make you fluent. Read books and articles and speak with native speakers if you're serious. Recent update made me have to start over in every language."

Charges (for 1 year) were some R1241. 86 all inclusive, debited upfront. That's just a rip off for an online language course. The meager benefits of Plus (paid subscription) compared with free subscription just don't justify the expense. I might consider a month to month paid subscription but it's only really useful on aeroplane flights where I don't have internet."
