I have done everything from reinstall's, memory resets and factory resets. Still the app just quits. If you are developing an app, maybe make sure it works with older devices as it did when it first came out. Maybe even test a bit before releasing it.

I have swiped right literally thousands of times and received not one match? It does show I have 10+ likes that one must pay for to see. A friend from my gym who is not at all good looking gets matches all the time? I do notice it asked me for my phone number to install but then lets me proceed without putting that info in? I have reinstalled once. Thanks."

Would like to see a new weight limit setting. That may sound mean but when swiping through before a match opens up we do judge by appearance. I understand there are some guys and ladys that do like plus size people, yet on the flipside some do not. If that filter would be added to Tinder it would be a 5star rating for me."

Might not be their issue, but I don't know if they don't get back to me.  Only giving them one star because no one from Life 360 will reach out to me and help and I cant use an app that drains that much battery.

This bug exists for months at least. In order to circumvent it I have to kill the app completely and it will finally show the new girl, however doing this might cancel my recent likes since the app begins to show people I have already liked/disliked.  Edit: so the way the bug works is that let's say you had 1 like to begin with from someone that you already saw but didn't swipe left or right. Later you get another one from someone else and it will show her mall picture. You enter the panel where you could see all the girls who liked you and it only show the first girl and not the recent ones. On top it says ""1 like"". If you swipe to refresh for a second the top line will say ""2 likes"" but then immediately changes back to ""1 like"" and the new girl's picture will never appear."

We recently switched to Spectrum and now all of the sudden our devices won't connect through the google home app. I have made sure the app is updated, restarted the router, disconnect and reconnect my phone from the Wi-Fi, etc., and nothing works. I can see the devices connected through the router's admin panel and I can ping them from my laptop, so it obviously isn't being blocked by the router settings. I have searched many forums and come to the conclusion that Google just doesn't want to fix the issue. This problem has been on the forums for over a year now and the developers should be able to figure something out. If this is a net neutrality issue, then maybe you should inform your consumers that due to corporate greed you will not be able to support the services you sold to your consumers. Very disappointed."

Do have one suggestion: It could be better if uninterrupted use of the app was noted in the daily history (or anywhere the entire circle can see) If any member's location was turned off at any time during that day, it would be helpful to know, so that proper use of the app can also be monitored- instead of only notifying the individual whose location is turned off without it being recorded or observable anywhere else. Thanks!"

Also, the GUI is clunky, counterintuitive and difficult to use. If Google made it function more like Netflix's or Hulu's apps, with a simple menu system and the necessary playback controls, it'd be a hit. The Chromecast device itself works great when playing videos but the app needs serious bug fixes and a total overhaul of the GUI. Keep the menu short and sweet with easy access."

You can verbally ask Hub for your specific news/music, but the display does not show your preferred by default. So display is almost useless and that's why you're buying it.

Like being able to show only people without kids or only people that are Democrats or filter out everyone ""not looking for a hookup"". Though I would make it so that you still show anyone that hasn't specified either way. So for example if you have an option to indicate political party and you filter for Democrats then only filter out Republicans and if they haven't specified then show them as well. Otherwise the reuslts will be too narrow when you launch the feature."

The 25+ likes should disappear the moment I swipe left on someone who swiped right on me, but this clearly isn't the case. Can the Tinder dev team please resolve this issue? I figure the reason they haven't bothered fixing this is because they want to trick users into wasting $13 on a worthless ""premium"" feature that just shows the users they've already swiped left on. Worthless."

Its strictly location based which makes it more of a hook up app. Sure you get a bio but that doesnt effect the stack.

The fact that someone you invite can remove you from the home is also problematic. This issue is only compounded by the fact that Google and Nest are merging services and if you merge your Nest account with your Google account you will loose the ability to limit access to your Nest products for anyone that is a Home member. They need to create an administrator role for the Home owner and allow them to control who is a member of the home and what permissions they have."

"Google Home","B Costeloe","May 10, 2019",3,"So buggy and convoluted once you start adding more devices and locations. If you have multiple ""homes""/locations, it's a broken MESS. If you dare to name your speakers/devices the same thing in multiple homes, you might turn on/off lightswitches or thermostats 1000 miles away while you're on vacation, for example. If you make speaker groups, and name that group ""All Speakers"" in each home location, the app will get confused and not show the appropriate group in the appropriate location. Google MUST test their software especially in use cases where there are multiple devices in multiple home locations...because right now it's broken. I have over 30 Google Home and Nest devices across 4 locations...I'm the kind of customer you should be trying to impress and maintain! Please, Google, debug your software! You need to create labs that test these everyday multi-location scenarios (different wifi networks, different ""homes""/locations, similar device and group names in different locations, etc). Thank you."

Hey devs, you know which of my other 100+ apps stop working just because my phone is in battery saver mode?? NONE OF THEM!!! . Too bad. Used2Büëç"

They fixed the bugs out and i was able to give my wife directions to get back home from an unfamiliar part of the city at night down to the second.

TV, router, and app / account links. I've rolled back the Google Home app and the TV firmware, by a few versions. Nothing has worked. One of the two have released and update that is incompatible with the other, and the feature, while still present in the app, is no longer functional. When it works, it works great. There are a lot of variables in a service like this. I was hoping it would be a tad more consistent. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be so reliable.

Once connected to the Hue Hub this app uploads the light bulbs along with EVERYTHING else, like lighting themes, remote control settings, etc. from the hub and lists it all as light bulbs. I ended up with 37 ""bulbs"" listed, even though I only have 11 actual Hue light bulbs.  I tried to delete the incorrect bulbs but the app wouldn't let me.  So to get rid of the ""Summer Sunset"" light bulb (even though it's a lighting scene, NOT a bulb), I had to create a new pseudo-room called ""Shed"" and assign the unwanted items to the ""Shed"" room to get them out of the list of real, actual, working Hue bulbs throughout my house.

By far it's best for tracking my teenage driver...I don't contact him when I can see he's driving, his ridiculous top speeds are recorded, he builds our trust as we verify that he really went where he says he did, etc. I use it many times, every single day. What a helpful use of technology."

I use it for my whole family so I can know where everyone is at anytime. it has real time tracking info. update: so more often than not. I can't track my family because it says we haven't left the house when in fact we have. It will say we are still at home when we have been gone for hours. This could be potentially dangerous if I ever have to use this in the event of an emergency I won't be able to. Please fix this bug or I might have to cancel my subscription."
