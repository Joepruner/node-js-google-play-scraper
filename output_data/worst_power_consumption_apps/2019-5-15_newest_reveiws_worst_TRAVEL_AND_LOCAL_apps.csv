Sorry, no more visual representation of your choices, which, by the way, you ONLY GET TWO NOW! No more alternate route, you have to go on one of the bad ones maybe! Now I have to go hunt for an old apk so I can downgrade. Thanks Google. EDIT: Now they've rolled out a forced update in a Android 9 security update. Thanks for being evil, Google."

"Maps - Navigate & Explore","Jason B","May 14, 2019",1,"Gives inaccurate directions an inefficient routes. This app is run you right into a traffic jam or heavy traffic roads rather routing you on less busy roads. Points destinations behind of buildings. Has outdated maps although you notify them of the error and they change nothing. App cant tell if you're still on a highway or exit from 500 ft apart but will say that you are at a destination of less than 200ft. You have to arrive on that point in order for the app to tell you that you've arrived."

Sure enough I try again and the road is still closed. What epic stupidity on Google's part. I'll never use this terrible app again. Driving on closed roads is illegal even if it's passable.

Very frustrating. Update: it's even worse than before, I give up. FINAL UPDATE: Nothing has changed, the app will suddenly stop working and close in the middle of a trip. Can't use it but can't get rid of it. Using another app now."

Cleared cache and uninstalled app. At this point I'm going to try a 3rd party app to force all sounds to go through Bluetooth. EDIT 2: Even the 3rd party apps can't fix Google Map's problem.

I have a problem and I'm telling you about it. If you can't get the right person on the job based on that, that's another problem, but it's your problem, not mine. It's bad enough that I can't call a phone number and just talk to someone to explain it all because writing is difficult for me."
