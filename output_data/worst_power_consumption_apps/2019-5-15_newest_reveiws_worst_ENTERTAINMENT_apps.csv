There is absolutely no problem for wife and me keeping up with the subtitles in these shows, but the plots are so predictable, and the acting leaves A LOT to be desired. It's worse than some of the old American ""B"" movies, and to be honest, the foreign actors who believe they are ready to make their American debut are quite laughable. Netflix, get a grip!"

You need to keep your price at a point the consumer feels irresponsible not having it...youve got that now. Concentrate on continued improvement...your competition is at its highest and getting stronger. Youve got a tremendous advantage being the first mover into streaming..."
