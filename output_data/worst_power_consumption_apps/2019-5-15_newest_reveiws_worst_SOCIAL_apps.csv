The app doesn't bend to Android's requests of making Adapticons, making use of Camera2 API for photography if available, disabling app for lower Android versions etc. Posts way too many notifications and is annoying and distracting. Notifies for baiscally no reason, I've switched to using the website for that reason."

But in android, you can only take pictures in this lens, you cant video yourself trying the filter. Please fix this because i love this app so much and i dont want it to get ruined just because of this one simple problem.Thank you!"

Also it zooms the images quite a bit. Stop halfassing the Android version and make it right for the first time in history already.

Yes of course they do, because there is only a small number of phones that Snapchat needs to be optimised for to get full IOS support, meanwhile android phones come in thousands of different models and configurations meaning updates take longer to optimize, extending release dates of updates. So please, stop ranting on about your conspiracy theories on how Apple is paying Snapchat to delay updates for android."

You are a person who gives value to money rather than ones emotions. Before you address a country remember you are a CEO and then do. That's not the way of criticising people of a respective nation. And this shows where you stand . You might be a business man who's focus is only on money and so doesn't wanna let access of  Snapchat in developing countries then why should you make snapchat available in those countries. It's your fault in providing access to the nation's you doesn't like. And now inturn you insulted the entire nation !! Shame on you . And I pity you Mr. CEO because even a child in India addresses​ other nations without criticisms. Now realise your mistake for addressing Indian nation as poor because we are not , rich in aspects of love, tradition, Heritage and many more .I strongly believe that you should apologize the entire nation."
