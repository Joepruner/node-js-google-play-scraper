Basically there is no way to enter new password. And also after changing the password 2days later got the notification. I think Microsoft has to think about their quality team. Such a simple issue is there since ever i started using this app. And also draft messages synching from laptop to mobile is very slow."

I find that OWA, Outlook mobile app, and the Outlook PC program never truly sync folder structures. Even right now in OWA I have 12 emails in my inbox, Outlook on my PC shows 6 in my inbox, and the Outlook mobile app shows 37. I recommend Google."

None of this occurs with the desktop version. This makes managing my inbox away from work an absolute nightmare."

I do not see my new emails in my inbox.  I get the notification and see it in the top banner area.  I select it to go to Outlook and outlook opens.  The new emails are not there.  I tried clearing cache, closing app, uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing works (shutting off my phone and restarting does not help).  While Outlook is open I will get a notice new emails have arrived and while I am looking at my inbox, they do not show up.  I found out that if I disable WifI, as soon as 4G takes over (takes a few seconds), the new emails come in.   Later in the day, emails will come in fine while I am on WiFi. Outlook has worked flawlessly for me for the last 3 years but the month or so sucked.  Quick update:  I forgot to mention that when I uninstall and reinstall, or just update it says the inbox needs to download the messages.  I will wait 5- 10 minutes and it would not update.  The inbox is empty.  As soon as I turn off the WiFi, the messages pop right in.  So the issue with my setup is, wifi is unreliable.  VW 4G works fine."
