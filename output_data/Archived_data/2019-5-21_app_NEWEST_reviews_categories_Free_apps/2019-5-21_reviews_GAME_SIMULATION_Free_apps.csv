"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","A Google User","March 21, 2019",5,"I LOVE this game, but warn you, its ADDICTIVE. I've been looking for a game like this for a long time. Its surprisingly realistic and graphics are good. The eagle is a little hard to control, but good. I only wish we could pick and choose where we den, like real animals. Otherwise, BEST simulator ever. If you have been looking, look no further! EDIT: Just got the horse, you have to kill animals for food so it's a little weird. Maybe change it so that there's a list of plants we have to forage for"

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","A Google User","March 20, 2019",5,"This game is is very good the only problems I have with this app is that when you watch an Ad to 1. Double you prize or 2. Get another chest, what somtines happen is it will boot you out of the game and the prize will not be doubled or the chest won't unlock. What gets me very annoyed about this is if you are in a roleplay or playing with your friends and this problem happens and that is furstrating. Also I reliazed that there is cannibalism in the game. Please fix these problems thank you."

Or make it optional? It cucks you more than anything. If you're just running by, it auto locks onto animals & pulls the camera in that direction. If you're trying to fight an animal & decide to run away, it usually makes you U-turn right back into the animal. & the boars/pigs are a little relentless. The maps are too barren. Dead. Lifeless.

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","Emilie Fisher","March 30, 2019",3,"An enjoyable game with some annoying flaws such as being unable to shake enemies that you tried to avoid to begin with, your family does not attack unless you do so you could be pregnant and running from an enemy that is constantly attacks you but so unless you can turn and land one hit they don't protect you. During pregnancy you run epically slower then there is the automatic attack when ever you near squirrels or rabbits that gets annoying. lastly, the game freezes when you're attacked"

Also, though, I already did all the achievements I could do before ANYTHING was gems, and all you could get were chests, so I wasted all my gems.

In the multiplayer only server, where the Bison boss is, higher level player, like for example a level 120 player, kills lower level player, so they can kill the Bison boss because they wanted to level up themselves. I know this because higher level player would actually say this. That is not fair for other players especially when they have to kill the Bison for their quest."

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","A Google User","March 8, 2019",1,"Wow, this game is terrible! The controls are really messed up, the camera is the main reason because when I am in a fight and run away the camera stays on the creature. So I end up going in a circle until I hit the incredibly tiny X button which stops the fight, everything you get from a box doesn't even go to your character. You can't use anything and the game doesn't count it as an item I won, then when I try fighting a skunk I am unable to deal any damage to it at all. Terrible game :("

When you get rid of battle arena i think you should do a creek with a crocidle boss. I know it sounds like cat sim but the croc will look different. And the animal should be a rabbit or fish.

There could be a volcano world, and an underwater world. As you unlock more creatures, you unlock worlds that are assigned to the animal. Thank you for reading my suggestion!"

Maybe you could have a food spot in the den so you could keep extra food, or adding a way to make wild animals (like the wolf in the winter forest) join your family. It would be great if you could add caves in the den and items like sticks that you can carry back to your den.

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","Ashley Long","March 23, 2019",4,"wonderful game, lots of fun, super addictive. my only issue is that there are not enough maps, you can only have 5 of each animal and leveling up is super difficult because you have to buy chests to do so. the chests are a good idea but they give more duplicate items than new items that you may need and the elixirs for leveling up go so fast because everytime you level up, the amount needed goes up by a lot. its understandable for the pet, but the main characters should be easier."

Its nice to spend time and meet new people online and there are always more quests ready to challange you. I dont really like how the Bison doesnt spawn anymore unless there are two players in the server. Like, what if youve nearly finished killing bison, and the second player left the game, and It just despawns after that hard work. :/ Apart from that, im fairly pleased with this game, I highly reccomend it for anyone whos reading this haha."

I've only used it on this device and it was only used by me not to mention the reason this is happening is because I had to re-download the game because it crashed every time I tried to load it up so thanks for screwing me over yet again.

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","Bunny60lazy","May 11, 2019",4,"its very fun to play. since they shortined the area the moose can run in, you can no longer get it stuck in the water. this caused me to have to find a fun strategy to beat it, which took me a while but was fun. it does drain a lot of battery and things tend to be expensive if they are being bought with gems instead of acorns. in experience, i found you cant really get the mystic items in normal chests. it would be good if they added a better chest for acorns or coins that would give you a chance"

If I am running away, because my character is weak, my point of view will automaticly changed to the enemy, causing me to run to the target instead. Other than that, It is a great game! It is quite hard to follow the location you want to go to in the map, but those are the only downsides!"

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","Danielle Berryman","April 3, 2019",3,"would be a great game, the idea is awesome but it's just another one of those games people make that just want your money and don't care about gameplay. you have to wait in between quests and the wait time gets longer every time and the quests are repetitive. animals don't wear clothes the clothes are dumb. add more features like communication with pack, side games, actual quests. maybe even kill humans lol like hunters. it's an okay game to pass time while waiting at the Dr right now tho 😂"

You can go online and talk with friends. You can make clans and have wars. Althought this game is not real world like, it is still a fun game to play. But I have a idea. On the battle arena, how about you get put with people that are your level. If there is no game found, you should be able to choose to go with higher level players or make a new game. I get killed a lot. Thank you."

One more thing, (sry) maybe have the boss' health not go back up when u leave and more u hit it, more it'll weaken. Thx so much! Sry 4 all the suggestions, but it's rlly great! LUV IT SO MUCH!! 😁😉"

I absolutely love this game, it provides a ton of features, fun gameplay, and new experiences; As well as a variety of animals, amazing graphics, and a TON of personalization options; But the only thing i find to be a little wrong about this game, is the dreaded lag. The only time lag goes away is when you're in your den, and that's not very good or fair to players. It makes it difficult to hunt, and is just- in general- very distracting. Is there a way to fix the lag?"

Can you make it so that you can choose a server, lock, etc. for battle arena, so that we can be able to join friends, clan mates, etc.? Thanks! Great game!"

I have been reported a lot by one person because they were ""pranking"" me and all those reports removed my chat for 7 hours. 2nd, its hard to get gems. What is also unfair about this issue is that pets and animals cost gems. 3rd, the names. People break rules by naming themselves innapropriate names then going at it. Those are all the unfair things i have noticed. Other than that, the game is really fun."

But my highest level is 22, it took me pretty long but only because I play this in my free time and I don't have a lot of that. But back on topic, I LOVED my journey from going higher and higher until I got more gems and acorns well for anyone who hasn't played the game.... I won't spoil it!

Click, Spam stun, rinse and repeat. Kill quests, one a day an very tedious. PvP only comes down to who gets the first hit/stun no skill involved.

"WildCraft: Animal Sim Online 3D","Dank chicken nuggets","March 17, 2019",4,"This game is fun and addicting BUT when in battle it doesn't allow you to look at what's infront of you when you're running. My tactic is to run and attack while im still in close enough range of the animal so I can deal damage without taking much in return but it only allows me to look back at the animals attacking me rather than seeing infront of me which causes me to run into trees and allow my enemies to kill me. Would like it if the creators did something to prevent this thanks 😁"

It would be cool if you expanded the map a little. And more enemies and bosses for them map like monkeys or smthn. And lastly can you please please add a deer or big cat as an animal you can play.

Thought it was supposed to have none hacker update lier lot of ppl quite playing cuz of that nobody wants to play with hackers that's gonna keep killing them for the fun of it specially when others tryna lvl up as well. i don't see how the boss lvl is a good thing we supposed to work together not against each other 😒."

It kicks me out all the way to home screen. Or it says that i dont have connection and i check my wifi and it says i am fully connected. Also i think you could lower the prices on gems. First you can change 3.99 for 50 gems to 1.99. 2nd change 9.99 for 220 gems to 5.99 at least. But anyways, this game is fun i play it every day plz make more updates thank you!"

After the recent update I've been getting kicked from my clan for no reason and I know no one has been expelling me. Many players are somehow still getting away with bullying and saying/naming themselves, clans, or pets inappropriate things. Finally, the battle arena rooms should be level based to prevent high level players from unfairly killing lower level ones, it makes the whole thing a frustrating drag."

There are 6 animals you can choose from once you get them in chests which doesnt take long. The graghics and gameplay are great and you have lots of customisable options for the animals you play. There are quests which help you gain exp and money to open chests to customise the animals. It would be great if your kids could have mates without branching the family and some more maps. and wing skins for wolves and animals"

Its great that you don't have to pay to get further but you can if you so choose. My current problem is the multiplayer area where the strong bision is. I wish you could allow us to open private games in that area because every time i go into one i get farmed by other players until I leave because they don't want me hunting the bision. It makes pretty much impossible to complete the quest to kill him every time I get it. Seeing as we aren't allowed to say the word jerk in chat it would be nice if you could create a safe way for the nice players to enjoy the benifits of that area. Either give the option to turn off PVP or something cause it sucks."

The mystic skins aren't all that good in some animals, mostly the Bear. It took me two days to get the skins I wanted, because the rates for each animal weren't evenly distributed. Some animals have higher attack than necessary too. And the boss gets drawn too early in the quests. Can't level fast enough to fight it. Lvl 30 boss. Lvl 18 player."

The movement of the camera is choppy not as smooth as other games, and I do have a problem with shadows stretching. I love the concept and graphics of the animals though! Landscape could use some more tweaking but I still enjoy the game. Should be able to choose who comes and goes on hunts as well as have interactions between family members."

However, if I'm honest, the game is the bare minimum of programming, and the graphics and animation are pretty awful. What really bothers me is the way they decided to integrate the horse playable, it's the only herbivore and the mechanics are awful. Instead of programming a new mechanics for a herbivore, you get to hunt animals for no reason and eat some random shrub it magically sprouts."
