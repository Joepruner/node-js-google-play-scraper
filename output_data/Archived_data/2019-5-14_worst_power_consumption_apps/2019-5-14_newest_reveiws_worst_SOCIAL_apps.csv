Also it's harder to swipe away the little video that goes in the corner when you exit videos. and I can't just swipe a post down to get out of it anymore. I would definitely suggest fixing these before doing anything else"

Another bug I found just recently is that someone sent me a Snap and I can not open it, it is just a black picture that lasts for 2 seconds and then disappears but the snap is not gone."

I don't need to be notified every single time someone in a group chat saves a photo, that I didn't send. There are multiple options for notifications, but any chat related notifications are lumped together. You either get every single notification of someone tapping a key on their phone and saving other people's photos, or get 0 of all messages. There's no reason for this."

But in android, you can only take pictures in this lens, you cant video yourself trying the filter. Please fix this because i love this app so much and i dont want it to get ruined just because of this one simple problem.Thank you!"

Yes of course they do, because there is only a small number of phones that Snapchat needs to be optimised for to get full IOS support, meanwhile android phones come in thousands of different models and configurations meaning updates take longer to optimize, extending release dates of updates. So please, stop ranting on about your conspiracy theories on how Apple is paying Snapchat to delay updates for android."

"Snapchat","A Google User","May 12, 2019",4,"I really like snapchat and the games are fun. But the game ""Snake Squad"" is annoying. I mean its a fun game, but theres a super power thats allows the person to not be able to be killed, and can kill you without ANYWAY OF STOPPING IT while having super speed. The superpower seems to last as long as you want it to. This needs to be fixed considering there is no way to actually stop it. Its just like randomly dying out of no where. There is no where to actually complain about this besides here"

They are censoring speech from anyone that doesn't agree with them. today they may be banning people you disagree with but tomorrow it may be you. This is scary stuff. Facebook has the power to influence the mines of billions of people through Gestapo like censorship. this is an evil platform and as un American as it gets. Look for a better app that would not silence your voice just because it doesn't fit their agenda."
