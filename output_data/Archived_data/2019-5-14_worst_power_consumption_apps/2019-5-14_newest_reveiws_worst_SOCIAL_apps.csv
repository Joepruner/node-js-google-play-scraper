Also it's harder to swipe away the little video that goes in the corner when you exit videos. and I can't just swipe a post down to get out of it anymore. I would definitely suggest fixing these before doing anything else"

But in android, you can only take pictures in this lens, you cant video yourself trying the filter.

I liked it better before the update I hope you guys can help I love snap it s just this problems."

"Snapchat","Chimeng Xiong","May 12, 2019",1,"These are bugs that I have experienced and you can not get rid of the bugged snaps, for example: if you can not successfully send a snap to someone, it glitched and now it just says ""Waiting to send..."", it does not give you an option to delete it or get rid of it so it is probably going to stay there forever. Another bug I found just recently is that someone sent me a Snap and I can not open it, it is just a black picture that lasts for 2 seconds and then disappears but the snap is not gone."

At second there should also be an option of adding description on any sticker you want not only on perticular stickers. There should also be an option for slecting all comments at once not one by one."

Shirt bursts of minor chuckles do not warrant a mediocre messaging app. The overall interface of the app is clunky and confusing; even after several days of using it, I could not get used to how difficult the interface is.

Meanwhile, the camera has improved, but it still needs tweaks to pump out better Quality snaps. Oh, and Netflix sharing kinda comes off just as a URL when being sent. Spotify share doesn't work either. More tinkering? Overall, keep it coming Fellas!"

I don't need to be notified every single time someone in a group chat saves a photo, that I didn't send.

You either get every single notification of someone tapping a key on their phone and saving other people's photos, or get 0 of all messages. There's no reason for this."

But in android, you can only take pictures in this lens, you cant video yourself trying the filter.

Not specific pages. Every. Single. One. Its pretty annoying to say the least when I have to try to hunt down an article on my browser because the Facebook app now can't handle links. Why fix what isnt broken, or at least test out your updates before releasing them."

"Snapchat","Astral Artist","May 12, 2019",3,"So I've been using snapchat for some years now and never really had a problem with it but recently there have been a lot of bugs that don't seem to be getting fixed. Every time I view my own or someone else's story it closes out even though I'm not done viewing it (and it's not on a timer). It's really annoying and frustrating because it happens every time and every time if I want to keep viewing it, I have to go back, find it and open it only to have it close out again within a few seconds."

There is hardly any support for devices outside IOS, so the performance and quality is terrible, even though the developers have been saying that they would fix this for years . It also lowers the camera quality alot. I only have it as it is just the main way of contacting people easily. If that wasn't the case, I wouldn't have downloaded it at all"

Also, let us change our usernames? Like what even is up with that? edit: even a while after, there are frame drops on the camera and filters, the app is slow, and the camera quality isnt native"

The filters take long to load and when they do they're incomplete. The app often crashes after i put snaps with stickers together and i loose the photo and work that ive done. Sometimes i like to get crafty with it and it sucks when ive spent 15 minutes putting together the perfect snap just for it to crash right before i try posting."
