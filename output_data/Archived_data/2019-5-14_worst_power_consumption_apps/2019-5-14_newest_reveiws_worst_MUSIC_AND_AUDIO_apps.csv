"Google Play Music","A Google User","April 30, 2019",1,"application crashes every song when the screen is off on the LG G8. It's ridiculous for an application update that made it to production to not have been tested on a flagship or an emulator. I have to say not only has Google's development team started slacking but it seems the management team is following suit lately. I am highly suspect that there's any kind of QA process that isn't laughable. it's a shame that Google can't hire and retain any kind of sustainable, viable Talent these days."

I couldn't even listen to my thumbed up album. I am not paying $10 a month of this. You just lost a customer and I am livid. I was so pleased now i regret letting it take up so much space. And a 30 free trial isn't worth trying. because even apple music gives you three months. youtube red used to give you three months. I used to love your app now Im saying bye."

Everytime Google Play Music starts, it starts with shufffle on and no way to turn it off. I don't want to switch to YouTube Music becasue my personal music collection can only be played through this app. Also, I love the radio option here. It uses less data than YouTube Music and it is not the same songs over and over again like with YouTube Music playlists."

I then have to look for the song to try and move it to where I want again, just for it to nove again. It is very tedious and annoying. I would enjoy it very much is this problem was fixed and Hotel California added to the songs I can get."

"Google Play Music","Amelia Gossett","May 12, 2019",1,"Music selection is standard, I guess but everything else frustrates me. The layout is awful. Too easy to do things you don't want cuz the buttons are too small/sensitive. Literally no options for organizing playlists and when you try to do it yourself you can't since the app's too glitchy. Also when a song is clicked, the album cover is all cropped down so you cant see it. And i cant go to another app because all the music is on the app exclusively. Idgaf about reccomemdation if the app sucks."

Also it will pick up your music files from your device. However my issue (and it's a big one for me) is that once I've actually PURCHASED music, I can't seem to download that music file. Quite frankly, it's the only reason I'm giving the app 3 stars, instead of 5. When I buy something it is mine; therefore I want to use it, how I want to use it & where I want to use it!"

I don't press any buttons so it's not like I'm somehow skipping through the songs myself, which isn't even possible. Also I know it's a bad glitch because the song will end before its time runs out.

As a oneplus user where i have used few other brands as well,this google music player doesn't impress much,mostly because its standard UI and it doesn't support any customizing,it doesn't have the equalizer option,it doesn't let you select what tabs that you want to have,an automatic play list according the mood etc etc. Dark mode is also not available. Samsung music,LG music player are examples."

Now normally I would say that this is a 3/5 but it has really got on my nerves. The app use to only do this once in awhile but now it getting worst. The worst part is that the app tell you it downloaded but also tell you it doesn't exist. when you check you phone the phone tell you that the music should be there."

The only reason why this isn't 5 stars for me is because this app and the website have been the same for ages it seems. I would love to see some more useful features built in or the app change over time. i.e. Configureable Smart Playlists, searchable playlists, additional columns for ratings and/or BPM.
