I actually take the time to report them which is not an easy task. A week later I checked to see if they closure was gone and maps said it's all clear. Sure enough I try again and the road is still closed. What epic stupidity on Google's part. I'll never use this terrible app again. Driving on closed roads is illegal even if it's passable.

"Maps - Navigate & Explore","Bhavesh Sadhu","May 10, 2019",2,"It has been more than a month that Maps is not working on my device properly. Whenever I press directions button it just searches for best route but takes very long to show the route and then when I start the navigation it just doesn't begin. It's very irritating.! The device I have is Nokia 7plus. I had raised the issue from the App in Help section but didn't get any response.!!!"

The forum doesn't provide any solutions so why do you keep directing people to the same forum so that we can read that the problem still has not been fixed.  Switched to the microsoft maps app.  Works great, but i would prefer to use google maps since i pay for google suites and have all my google docs automated to sink with google maps."

I want to see the names of the roads beforehand -- but, no. ""Steps and more"" will give names like ""State Route 75"" or something equally stupid to a road that nobody calls it, ever. Oh, and ""continue straight for 1.6km"" tells me almost nothing. Tell me AND THEN WHAT well beforehand, not when I'm in the middle of an intersection or worse."

"Maps - Navigate & Explore","Wallace Chui","May 10, 2019",3,"I haven't had any excuse to explore this app, but I'm already disappointed. It's slow at best, sometimes unresponsive; what I mean by that is using the search query takes forever, I have to spam tap it for it to even open up. Typing from there is fine, but again I have to repeatedly press ""Enter"" before it takes me back to the map. I'd like to say this app is at least reliable in terms of using it as a GPS, but as someone else has already stated it doesn't always choose the best routes."

My biggest issue with Google maps right now is that it limits the number of reports you can make. This doesn't make sense because let's say you're sitting in traffic and U report there is a slow down and then you get further up and there's an accident and you want to report the accident it doesn't let you.

Transit times alone make sense when driving a car, but they really mess with perception on a list comparing multiple options. Always pay attention to the smaller print stating ""arrival time""."

If this app wasn't free I'd never use it, itll get the job done but the AI is meh"
"Maps - Navigate & Explore","Brian Martinko","May 7, 2019",1,"literally doesn't even work. It just gives you a preview but no longer actually gives you directions. edit. I'll gladly tell you what else I'm experiencing. when I just try to look at the map, this stupid app can't even put me within 20 miles of where I actually am. It no longer provides directions, it just decides I'm somewhere between here and Tibet and puts me there on a map and there is nothing I can do to tell it it's wrong. This app is beyond wothless. blow it up and start over"

"Maps - Navigate & Explore","A Google User","May 7, 2019",4,"Overall I like Google Maps; I use it often, find it useful, and even contribute to it, but it's not perfect. Most annoying flaw; it assumes I've visited places that I've merely been near to (sometimes only driven past), asking me to review them. I tell it ""I havn't been here"" and the item goes away (good), only to re-appear in the list next time I use the app (bad). What's the point of having this ""I havn't been here"" option if the app refuses to believe me and won't remove the entry?"

This is only occurring in Maps, and only when typing within the app. Even as I type this, it is not occurring, but does so persistently within the application. Even so, the app is fantastic...work that bug out, and we're back to normal!"

"Maps - Navigate & Explore","Jeff Thorstad","May 9, 2019",1,"Edit: my original issue was fixed. however, new problem. Any time there are multiple stops input, and the route between those stops crosses itself (eg, the route goes thru the same intersection more than once), the app treats each crossing of the route as if it reached the next stop. This means you can be miles away from the next stop, but the screen jumps to the ""Arrived"" screen. Just because you went thru a point on a road that is also a later part of the route."

Hate not being able to put in locations from the phone (sometimes the passenger is the navigator, Big Brother) when connected via Android Auto. Least with Waze you can specify Not the driver and retain control. Only voice commands is worse than allowing use of the touch screen in the car. Nice features otherwise but not my go to map app by a long shot."
