The interface is focused mainly on showing you curated lists, rather than on facilitating the browsing of content by genre. You CAN select genres, of course, but even then, it just displays more curated lists related to your selection. I'm running out of space in this review, so I'll just say that the Netflix app is very much the type of stripped down, mobile experience you've probably come to expect."
