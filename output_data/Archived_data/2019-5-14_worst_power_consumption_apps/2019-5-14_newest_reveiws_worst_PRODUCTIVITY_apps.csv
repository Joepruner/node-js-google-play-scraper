"Microsoft Outlook","Abdul Ahad Khan","May 6, 2019",2,"A VERY buggy app. Keeps giving newer issues all the time. Started off by causing sync issues every month, requiring a full reset/account wipe. The search feature is sorely lacking functionality. The menus sometimes don't load at all. Refuses to load messages by clicking notifications in drawer at times. Messages in drawer don't appear inside the app for a while until the full message is loaded, causing confusion between people. No significant improvement in a long time despite manifold feedback."

If you want to delete, you always have to open the email fully to delete."

What happens now is this: Tell a joke, it brings up result in a search tab where it says ironically: Go to Assistant for more jokes, I click that and it just keeps looping like that, well disappointed with this ""better"" version..."

In the next update, please make this app support front/back camera to input looking/view. From here then the AI can give an answer about what she/he look. I think this will be interesting new feature. U know, something realtime. 2. I hope this AI can also sing every songs. 3. I want this AI can also use any sensors on our phone.

I do not see my new emails in my inbox.  I get the notification and see it in the top banner area.  I select it to go to Outlook and outlook opens.  The new emails are not there.  I tried clearing cache, closing app, uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing works (shutting off my phone and restarting does not help).  While Outlook is open I will get a notice new emails have arrived and while I am looking at my inbox, they do not show up.  I found out that if I disable WifI, as soon as 4G takes over (takes a few seconds), the new emails come in.   Later in the day, emails will come in fine while I am on WiFi. Outlook has worked flawlessly for me for the last 3 years but the month or so sucked.  Quick update:  I forgot to mention that when I uninstall and reinstall, or just update it says the inbox needs to download the messages.  I will wait 5- 10 minutes and it would not update.  The inbox is empty.  As soon as I turn off the WiFi, the messages pop right in.  So the issue with my setup is, wifi is unreliable.  VW 4G works fine."

"Microsoft Outlook","David Weprin","May 8, 2019",1,"Avoid. I have spent two weeks trying to use this and have found that a great many defects make this app not worth the time. Examples of bugs are plentiful, but to name just a few: 1) Some new emails do not appear unless you close and reopen the app. 2) Pinch-zooming causes unexpected scrolling, rather than zooming in where you are pinching. 3) Some emails will appear as having been read even though they are unread, and vice versa. 4) There is no way to view calendar attachments."

Both are complementary, in my opinion. While Google Assistant is a great app for managing appointments and giving information Bixby is amazing because it can basically manage everything in my phone, even device's settings. If I have to choose one, between Bixby and Google Assistant I'd rather choose Bixby because it makes more than Google Assistant, not much, but slightly more."

"Microsoft Outlook","Kevin Granville","May 7, 2019",4,"overall its a good app. the one thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is the fact that it's not easily paired with Google calendar. i was blown away to find out that wasn't an easy option to integrate. i ended up having to add my corporate email to outlook and the ""other"" email program on my phone so the mail syncs on outlook and the calendar syncs on the other. it was a pain but solved the problem"

"Microsoft Outlook","John Mood","May 7, 2019",1,"Just O.K., not great. Will not always download the entire mesage. I used it for about three months, and it failed to load the whole message more often than not. Used it, found it to be insufficient and uninstalled. And WHO decided to post a ""noreply"" address for the support email? Microsoft DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM END USERS!"
"Microsoft Outlook","Hugo Gallardo","May 7, 2019",5,"Very good app. But I would like to be able to swipe thru emails and flag completed emails and mark an email as urgent. swipe thru emails has been added and it's awesome. needs to be capable of marking flagged emails as checked or completed instead of uncheck."

"Microsoft Outlook","A Google User","May 14, 2019",1,"Not customisable enough - cant change number of preview lines and it has annoying button bars top & bottom (top for email filters and bottom to select email/search/calendar). I want RID of them - they take up too much room and mean that i cant see a near fullscreen email list. Also, incoming emails from known domains dont show sender avatars/favicons, just a letter based on sender name. And major oversight is that you cant mark emails as spam!"

"Microsoft Outlook","A Google User","May 14, 2019",1,"This app is surprisingly awful! Not fit for purpose! It refuses to allow me to set up some of my email accounts, and the calendar simply does not work. If this isn't bad enough, the email account that was working okay has now stopped altogether, and resetting it failed to get it functioning again. Consequently, now neither email nor calendar  work. Obviously a fix must be the order of the day. Is this likely? Have now uninstalled the app as it is literally a waste of space!"
