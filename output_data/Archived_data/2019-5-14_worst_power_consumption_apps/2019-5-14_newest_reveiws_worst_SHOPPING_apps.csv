I thought I can by pass it by clicking past the ad when it was a sign up sheet. I was hoping to keep that free trial to test out when I really needed it. But no! Instead of respecting the customer's needs you force them to sign up so they would pay out of pocket for a monthly fee of two day shipping after the trial when they might not buy that much every month."

Make sure you filter reviews for verified purchases only. Take the time to call Amazon when you run into crappy sellers. APK works well and Amazon continues to develop and add features/functionality.

One motor had a hole in the piston shaft because whoever drilled the hole for the engine block bolts drilled sideways into the piston. This isn't acceptable!

I've even returned products and had sellers just tell me they never got them and refuse money back and I've also had times I've never recieved products.

Instead it's twice or triple the price. Prime isn't really a thing anymore. Some actually arrive in 2 days. A lot more often the item takes 3 or more days to even leave the warehouse. Very misleading. And you can't comment on reviews using the app or downvote irrelevant reviews. The old app worked better than this one."
