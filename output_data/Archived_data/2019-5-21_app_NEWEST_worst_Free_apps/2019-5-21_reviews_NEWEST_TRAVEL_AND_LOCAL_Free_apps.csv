"Maps - Navigate & Explore","email user","May 17, 2019",4,"1. It's not designed well for switching between google accounts. For example if you save a map to the phone, only the account it was downloaded under can use that map. (If you want to share save places information between accounts, it's best to use one account to follow the saved paces of the other account, instead of switching between accounts.) 2. Really ENJOY the ""Your Places"" menu, especially the ""Upcoming"" section which shows the places from your google calendar events!!!  3. Travel history needs to be made  useful for users and shown in a nicely formatted  monthly mileage report! Not just a timeline, but a downloadable report with each trip and the mileage.  That would be GREAT!""  Seeing visited points on a map is useless!! 4. Consistency in spoken distance measurements would help. I would prefer if it always said 1.4 miles or .5 miles. Instead of in a quarter mile, or in 800 feet. No one would be expected to know what .4 miles is, but when it says 800 feet I am thinking it is expecting me to measure."

Also the map should zoom in sooner before turns, when the map is small it seems like you need to turn but really your turn is the next traffic light.

Karena dalam perjalanan kita sering terpisah. Kalau ada fitur ini kita tidak perlu tanya, ""sudah sampai mana?"" Saya merasa ""fitur group"" sangat berguna bagi orang yg pergi bersama sama lebih dari satu kendaraan."

Just to open it up and enter in a destination address takes way longer than it should because it's loading so much other data that isn't helpful when you're just trying to get somewhere.

The contribution feature for adding reviews of places and photos is quite unwieldy as it has delays in processing, editing and filtering my content. How to add a foot path as opposed to a road is not clear . Even adding places by gps coord required an road address it seems."

I hope you can shed some light and help me out, thank you."

UI on android is too bad and super buggy when it comes to displaying content with stops added en route."

If I wanted to explore an area guess what, I'd use Google search, I don't want half my map screen taken up with stupid pointless ads. Used to be great, basic, fully functional app that yet again Google has ruined by trying to fix the unnecessary. At the very least let me decide whether I want this nonsense don't impose it on me."
