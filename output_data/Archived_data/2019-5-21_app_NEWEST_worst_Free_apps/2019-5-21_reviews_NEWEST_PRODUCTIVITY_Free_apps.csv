The big concern was whether apps would work as well on a $400 Moto as they do on an iphone because this app is crucial for work. It works just as well in Android form. If Outlook is part of your work life, it is flawless in this system. if you think it might benefit you, help you with appointments and email management, my guess is you'll come to prefer it. My review is simple. It works great."

It will read my notifications and facebook messages, but even though I specify TEXT messages, it just won't read those. And when I say to send a facebook message, it says ""Sorry, I don't know how to do that yet."" Y'all's AI is acting up. Will y'all fix it? Also, when I try to use it while I'm driving, TWO different voices ask to help, but neither of them do. Frustrating to no end .... ."

What happens now is this: Tell a joke, it brings up result in a search tab where it says ironically: Go to Assistant for more jokes, I click that and it just keeps looping like that, well disappointed with this ""better"" version..."

In the next update, please make this app support front/back camera to input looking/view. From here then the AI can give an answer about what she/he look. I think this will be interesting new feature. U know, something realtime. 2. I hope this AI can also sing every songs. 3. I want this AI can also use any sensors on our phone. Compas, location, light sensor, etc"

Now I can't do it on the phone or tablet. Trying to figure how to make it respond like that is impossible. It's called getting worse, when things should be getting better.   But then again google is expert at making things more complex. I use to use IE explorer to browse (started with netscape), then it got worse not running smoothly, but it was simple. Chrome took over as number one position, but they are always more steps to do what explorer did in one. I think google is collaborating with MS, because they are the same. Like MS Word. It use to be simple, now it's extra steps to do everything, like print, it's now three steps. You actually have to leave the page to print something. Just like Google. Why? Because they have techies running everything and they like complexity, yet the public wants simplicity. And google runs the world now, so they don't care. It's called a monopoly"

I do not see my new emails in my inbox.  I get the notification and see it in the top banner area.  I select it to go to Outlook and outlook opens.  The new emails are not there.  I tried clearing cache, closing app, uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing works (shutting off my phone and restarting does not help).  While Outlook is open I will get a notice new emails have arrived and while I am looking at my inbox, they do not show up.  I found out that if I disable WifI, as soon as 4G takes over (takes a few seconds), the new emails come in.   Later in the day, emails will come in fine while I am on WiFi. Outlook has worked flawlessly for me for the last 3 years but the month or so sucked.  Quick update:  I forgot to mention that when I uninstall and reinstall, or just update it says the inbox needs to download the messages.  I will wait 5- 10 minutes and it would not update.  The inbox is empty.  As soon as I turn off the WiFi, the messages pop right in.  So the issue with my setup is, wifi is unreliable.  VW 4G works fine."

No matter how good the suggestions are, it I first have to say 'Ok google' uncomfortably for a few times then the experience can still be bad. How about giving the flexibility of setting own keywords? Thanks."

Since then I replaced the device and I now have a Samsung S9 Plus, which is a modern phone at the time I write this review.    The issue is that I am able to summon Google Assistant by saying ""OK Google"".  The device starts listening but it won't capture what I say.  When enough time elapses, I get a message"" saying ""tap the microphone icon or say ""OK Google"""".  I tap the mic, say what I want and nothing is captured...
