If Outlook is part of your work life, it is flawless in this system. if you think it might benefit you, help you with appointments and email management, my guess is you'll come to prefer it.

Now I can't do it on the phone or tablet. Trying to figure how to make it respond like that is impossible. It's called getting worse, when things should be getting better.   But then again google is expert at making things more complex. I use to use IE explorer to browse (started with netscape), then it got worse not running smoothly, but it was simple. Chrome took over as number one position, but they are always more steps to do what explorer did in one. I think google is collaborating with MS, because they are the same. Like MS Word. It use to be simple, now it's extra steps to do everything, like print, it's now three steps. You actually have to leave the page to print something. Just like Google. Why? Because they have techies running everything and they like complexity, yet the public wants simplicity. And google runs the world now, so they don't care. It's called a monopoly"

I do not see my new emails in my inbox.  I get the notification and see it in the top banner area.  I select it to go to Outlook and outlook opens.  The new emails are not there.  I tried clearing cache, closing app, uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing works (shutting off my phone and restarting does not help).  While Outlook is open I will get a notice new emails have arrived and while I am looking at my inbox, they do not show up.  I found out that if I disable WifI, as soon as 4G takes over (takes a few seconds), the new emails come in.   Later in the day, emails will come in fine while I am on WiFi. Outlook has worked flawlessly for me for the last 3 years but the month or so sucked.  Quick update:  I forgot to mention that when I uninstall and reinstall, or just update it says the inbox needs to download the messages.  I will wait 5- 10 minutes and it would not update.  The inbox is empty.  As soon as I turn off the WiFi, the messages pop right in.  So the issue with my setup is, wifi is unreliable.  VW 4G works fine."

Both are complementary, in my opinion. While Google Assistant is a great app for managing appointments and giving information Bixby is amazing because it can basically manage everything in my phone, even device's settings. If I have to choose one, between Bixby and Google Assistant I'd rather choose Bixby because it makes more than Google Assistant, not much, but slightly more."

Tried a uninstall but now can't install it again."
"Microsoft Outlook","Stephen Andersen","May 20, 2019",1,"I wish I could give zero stars. This app after recent updates has become all but useless. It sucks down battery at an amazing rate. I get notifications but cannot access the incoming email. And most critically, the app constantly pauses, freezes and often crashes and has to shut down on my galaxy S8. I use this daily for business and it has become so problematic I am looking for an alternative. Challenging since we use Office 365 for work. FIX IT!"

Since then I replaced the device and I now have a Samsung S9 Plus, which is a modern phone at the time I write this review.    The issue is that I am able to summon Google Assistant by saying ""OK Google"".  The device starts listening but it won't capture what I say.  When enough time elapses, I get a message"" saying ""tap the microphone icon or say ""OK Google"""".  I tap the mic, say what I want and nothing is captured...  It is disappointing and at times embarrassing, when others are around.  Then I have to hear ""wanna borrow my iPhone?""  :("
