The album art is zoomed in too far so artist name/album are off the edge of the screen, the garish white background cannot be changed, no equaliser.....The Spotify app manages all of the above successfully, so I have to go back to them!"

One annoying thing is when I scroll a playlist, especially when the playlist gets to the end, it is too easy to cause a false swipe to remove a track from playlist. This happens all the time and is really annoying. At least there is an undo option but if you miss the undo, you e lost the track forever! Make it less sensitive please."

So it just didn't play anything because I don't subscribe. 2-The app plays ads when I listen to my offline music. I should NEVER have to listen to ads when I have already paid for each of the songs I am listening to. No other app does that"

Like literally I just skipped over 200 times and the same 12 tracks cycled thru and NOT ONCE was rhe song one by the artist WHOSE RADIO STATION IT WAS. Like literally the opposite of what you would want. This is ridiculous and dysfunctional. Google obviously does not care ahout the user experience"

The Spotify account bundle ended for me so I've used Google music exclusively for a few months. It has been pretty buggy. I ran it on my old Xperia and my S9 now and it often randomly stop playing mid song. It's getting annoying enough that I'll be switching back to Spotify even though it will cost more for my family. Also found Spotify's stations better curated."

Protip to some having problems: Try clearing your cache/data and restart songs. If you try and listen to music on a bad connection it will attempt to jump to the next song and never complete the download on the previous song in order to prevent freezing or long silences. Previously played songs are cached even if incompleted."

The goal of this app should be to help the users find new music. Also, anywhere that has the 3 dot menu should provide the options 'go to artist' and 'go to album'. You can no longer do this from your recents and it's a pain. Return these features and it will be 5 star again"

And the layout is just obnoxious... I was constantly accidentally rearranging my music, podcast episodes don't autoplay, you have to subscribe to change the episode order, you can't leave reviews like every single other app. It just seems ludicrous to me that you charge that much. Whoever designed this app obviously has never actually used it."

Too easy to do things you don't want cuz the buttons are too small/sensitive. Literally no options for organizing playlists and when you try to do it yourself you can't since the app's too glitchy. Also when a song is clicked, the album cover is all cropped down so you cant see it. And i cant go to another app because all the music is on the app exclusively. Idgaf about reccomemdation if the app sucks."

What keeps me here over other music streaming services is its chromecast ability and ability to manually upload music into your library. It's a great service...however, it's in need of an update. While all of the other ""google play"" apps recieve clean/shiny new interfaces, GPM is left looking archaic. Since Google is unfortunately looking to end the service within the next year or so (in favor of YT music), they don't seem to be putting much TLC into the app. Shame."

"Google Play Music","Luis Rodriguez","May 10, 2019",1,"Garbage app since one of their most recent updates. This app was the best app for streaming music. Streaming is the purpose I subscribe to them. Recently it's been skipping songs and the app refuses to play them. Their tech team says you'll need to download the song. Well that's not why I pay for this service. it's to stream not to download music. If I wanted that I would just buy the song. So switching to another streaming service immediately."

And no, its not the reception; ive had a passenger watch to see if it was. I use this in my car and itd for sure make me crash if I fiddled with it, so 90% of the time my drive has no music. I was gonna pay for premium, but yeah not happening. Garbage."
