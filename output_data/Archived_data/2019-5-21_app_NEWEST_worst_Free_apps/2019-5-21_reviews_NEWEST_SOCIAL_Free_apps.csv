My 5 year old iPhone which is quite slow in general use runs Snapchat fine, so clearly an issue with their app for Android. Also picture quality looks terrible on Android!

This may seem like only a small issue but it very quickly makes invalid the functionality and purpose of the service being provided"

Give it a try and you will see your battery lasting 4x longer. * and the only reason its got 1 billion downloads is because its so buggy people have to download it multiple times * still a huge battery drain. Go and uninstall it for a day and see how much battery you save. I saved 75% battery!! * WHERE IS FACEBOOK LITE in Australia? Thats the best facebook app but its not here. Release it for Australia already Fakebook."

Sending messages continues to lag and takes a minute or so to send at least on both sides and sometimes the app doesn't register that's you've checked the message at all. Aside from the bugs, please consider adding a ""night mode"" or ""dark theme"". White strains the eyes."

From a screen that shakes when taking pics/videos through the viewfinder (no issues with my actual camera) to flashing green segments across the screen also. The latest glitch is that when I open a message someone has sent me, the icon left is as if I've messaged them and they've opened my message. With constant ads too, not sure how great this update has been."

"Snapchat","Ben Stephenson","May 20, 2019",4,"A good social app and easy to use. It does occasionally crash and glitch out but usually restarting the app fixes this. It's great for meeting new people but as it's the internet some people will mis-use this. I don't see the benefit to Snapmaps and as it's there, people should have their location off, on ghost mode or only allowing certain people they know in real life to see their location."

Why is it tht ppl who follow rules have been removed/banned,etc?I KNOW 1st hand bc my 13yos fb ws DISABLED & we dk WHY,they're nt political,they follow the rules. Fb did nada when I got unsolicited amateur porn sent to me,same after getting threats abt some1 kidnapping my kids,yet FB disabled my 13yos fb? So Fb can afford to do wht they feel like, DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT though. Quite disappointing."
