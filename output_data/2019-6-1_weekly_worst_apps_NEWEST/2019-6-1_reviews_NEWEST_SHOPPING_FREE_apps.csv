It is actually one of the worst I've ever tried-- especially when compared  with the Amazon website.  I couldn't find a way to navigate.   There is a menu to go back to the home page, so you can have the pleasure of redoing your search from scratch.  Seriously? No back button?  If there is a way to navigate it is hidden really well.  The sorting features are mostly missing.  I couldn't find a way to filter by size, department, manufacturer, and etc.  As we all know there are a LOT of products on Amazon, so lack of sorting makes for a painful shopping experience-- takes forever to find stuff.  I definitely won't be shopping with this app.  I immediately deleted it from my phone-- it's a total waste of storage space."

LG already comes with Amazon Prime app pre-installed - which also can't be deleted, so LGs have 2 memory-hogging Amazon apps. App tries to trick users into signing up for Prime each time it opens; hides most low-priced items in searches sorted from low to high price, and uses several other tactics to make users spend more.

Make sure you filter reviews for verified purchases only. Take the time to call Amazon when you run into crappy sellers. APK works well and Amazon continues to develop and add features/functionality.

I was looking at a review for bluetooth earbuds but as I looked at the comments, I saw things about a case which left me confused so I checked other products and the same issue. The reviews for the products were not in correlation with the product itself so there's no way to know whether the product you're purchasing will be of good quality or not as you don't have the other comments explaining if the product is faulty or not."

Wishlists are no longer accessable by just long pressing the product and dragging it which also means, if you are a shopper who likes to add multiple product to wishlist and then quickly compare and only buy from your budget preference etc etc and keep the rest for next time, that's a no from Amazon. Forget the precise filtering. That's terrible now too. Bring back the old app."

With Subscribe and Save, it is now (03.2017) slow and difficult to edit individual items in a delivery (ie to skip or move them to another delivery) because one must wait for entire orders to slowly download whereas it is now easier than ever to ADD to a monthly delivery! In short, it's easier to be charged more money but frustrating for the customer."

Customer service assures me ""it won't happen again"" each time. This time it overdrew my account and since a refund takes 3-5 days, the bank charged me $37. So two samples cost me $41 but in 3 days I'll have a whole $3.98 refunded! It sucks up memory, I cannot turn off 1 click settings. All it is good for is tracking your order. I did not have this problem 6 months ago. Being Amazon, nothing will be done."
