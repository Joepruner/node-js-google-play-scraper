Most of the functionality you need is there, but the ability to select the period of offline storage is absent (and that's a big mistake).  Also, WHY, oh WHY, has Outlook on mobile devices NEVER had the 'Send As' feature which Outlook for PC has had FOREVER?????  In order for me to conduct my business using this app, I HAVE to have 'Send As' and make it work with both on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online.

"Microsoft Outlook","Mike King","May 28, 2019",3,"Gives me the ability to have most of the same Outlook functions on my handheld that I have on my desktop. But I've found two significant drawbacks: 1 - if the Internet connection is not speedy, it's not able to get mail from the server (I never had this issue when using my phone's native email client configured to pull from the Exchange server), and 2 - sometimes, when a calendar event notification fires and I dismiss it, it keeps firing every minute after that, getting quite annoying. If these issues aren't fixed, I'll likely revert to using the native email app on my phone."

"Microsoft Outlook","Lisa Warden","May 28, 2019",1,"Does not refresh Inbox!!! 98% of the time, Inbox is grossly out of date, as emails are not pushed to the app Inbox, and the Inbox does not refresh on demand. There is no indicator whatsoever to inform you that you are missing emails, that the last refresh was as if x datetime, that it has whatever problem is has that results in not working at all. Totally unacceptable, and gives me such an impression of too large and monopolizing a company to care about customer service."
