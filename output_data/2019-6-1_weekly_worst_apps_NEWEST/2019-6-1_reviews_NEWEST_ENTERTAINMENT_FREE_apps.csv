My idea would be HD and 1 stream would be £5.99 and £7.99 for 2 streams and £11 for 4 streams. my idea gives consumers choice and flexible plus when Disney+ comes this year you'll need to be more competitive."

You've always been a five star in my view but lately I've been going mad because you've actually made it even more challenging to choose films... PLEASE PLEASE indicate the countries of origin of your movies. It's so simple, you've already got the space: Name of Movie 2018 UK/Eng Name of Movie 2019 MEX/Spa/Eng Sub Name of Movie 2018 CAN/Fr/Eng Sub Adding the Director's name would be icing on the cake.

What bothers me is the app refues to keep track of what part I left off on. Jumping from season to season or starting a title completely over. It even gies so far as to say Ive never even watched the title. its only been doing this since the recent update. I might as well just watch the shows on cable TV if I can't pick up from where I left off."

One last thong is they should start to do something like you can save a movie or show and keep it there. Or if you don't like a show you can like hold it down and delete it from there and you can ask or request a movie or show you want back or a new one."

Impossible to search . your suggestions are all the same movies Netflix shoves down your throat and every single genre. only up votes... you cant get rid of garbage you dont want to see. same crappy movies served up front and center, trending, new releases, for you. what a waste of time and money.

Most of the time I can't find it on whatever page I'm on. Sometimes it's on the Home page, sometimes not. Netflix is a very good service, but they need to hire an app developer who tests their UI design on real people rather than in-house people who already know the app."
