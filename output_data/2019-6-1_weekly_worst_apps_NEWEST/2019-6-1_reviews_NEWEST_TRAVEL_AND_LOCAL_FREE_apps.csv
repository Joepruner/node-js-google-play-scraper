The only reason I give it a 4 star is that over time, there appears to be some fraying at the seams.  1.  First, starting approximately around the time of the Oreo release, the app has bloated to the point that it now takes exceptionally long to load and it has become generally very sluggish.  It still works great once it starts.  2. Second, voice navigation over bluetooth is now partly broken (though this may be because of Oreo's issues with the older BT standards rather than the app itself).  Specifically, the voice instructions truncate over BT unless there is another app that keeps BT active (e.g. playing music via an app or running some of the apps designed to work around this problem)."

Now when opening the app, you no longer see a map, you see a cultural tour of the area you are in. Having a tab that shows nearby businesses is nice but having it forced in your face everytime you open the app is not. sometimes I have to hit the back button 2 or 3 times to see the map... and its a 'Map App' ..."

Fix suggested by developer worked for 4 days. Update in April 2019 finally working. Turned off auto update of app. Developers should keep in mind that not everyone can afford a new phone every other year, so app needs to work with older phones too. Developer reply 2019-05-29 stated issue fixed and I should update, so I did, and now app crashes after pressing ""Start"". Using Waze."
