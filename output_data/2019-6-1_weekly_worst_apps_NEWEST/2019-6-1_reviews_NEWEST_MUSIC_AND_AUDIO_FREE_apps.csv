"Google Play Music","Shan Sharma","May 18, 2019",1,"If you are confident about the App you created being competitive why asking for payment details for the free trial period? Instead of asking me to cancel anytime within 30 days to avoid charges, ask for the payment details while on trial seeking feedback if your App lived up to the expectations. The model now is just expecting someone to miss that 30th day and you could charge for a month. Very bad! I don't see any improvement in the layout or the listing from the time I've been using this App!"

So it just didn't play anything because I don't subscribe. 2-The app plays ads when I listen to my offline music. I should NEVER have to listen to ads when I have already paid for each of the songs I am listening to. No other app does that"

I figured it needed an update or maybe I should reinstall it. I opted for the reinstallation method. I uninstalled it and now Google Play isn't letting me redownload it. So how exactly am I supposed to use it now?"

However, recently it has been glitching and only playing the song for the first few seconds and then going mute. No matter how many times I pause and replay the song, it still won't have any sound. I only got it to work by playing a song on a different platform (Pandora, YouTube, etc.) and then hitting play on Google Play. Ugh. Seems like I'm not the only one having this issue. PLEASE FIX!

This is helpful for folks coming over after years on other podcast apps. Also needs option to download episodes for later playback in places where there is no cell reception. Huge problem driving out west where you can go hours without reception. Add those two features, and I'll raise my rating from 2 to 4 stars, 5 if you add something extra that exceeds my expectations."

Also, it will not let me make a downloadable playlist longer than 100 songs. I work 12 hour shifts in a remote area with no internet connection, so 100 songs is not even enough to get through a day."

And one last thing, can you let users change the background color of the app (not everyone likes orange) and add a Dark Mode please? Please make these changes, or do these for YouTube Music"

"Google Play Music","Johnson Bui","May 22, 2019",3,"The app is great and works great by itself when on a phone. However, there are some glaring issues when used in conjunction with other products.  When used with Google Home products, I'll select a song and it's 50/50 if it'll play or immediately skip over the song. I've learned to pick the song before the actual song that I want to play when interacting with my Google Home devices, but wow.... Please note that this issue only occurs in this specific app.  When used with my Fossil Sport watch, downloading playlists doesn't work most of the time which is infuriating.   Not only that, the app will lag the whole system when playing songs. I noticed a particular source of the lag is when the album photo is trying to cache and load. It also detriments the general interface. Please give us the option of disabling this.  In the interest of debugging, I experience these issues every single day and am using the following devices:  Pixel 2, Google Home Mini (2 of them), Google Home Hub, Google Chromecast Ultra, and Fossil Sport 41mm  I have also performed all the usual tips and tricks such as restarting, reinstalling, and getting a replacement watch."

I'm a paid subscriber and absolutely love it because I can add my own music library to supplement what they aren't able to provide. A VERY recent update however removes any remix information from the queue. If a song on an album is a remix it will show as such on the album page, but not on the playlist or Now Playing. I hate that! If I'm listening to a Gui Boratto remix, why tell me on the track listing then make it impossible to find again?"

If you try and listen to music on a bad connection it will attempt to jump to the next song and never complete the download on the previous song in order to prevent freezing or long silences.

Thanks to all who have made this in my opinion one of the best music apps out there.  If you want all your music from iTunes on Play Music then download Play Music Manager. I have transferred thousands of songs onto my Play Music account. The amazing thing is once you load all your music from your different locations using Music Manager IT STAYS on Play Music. I have deleted and downloaded the play music app to test this out and sure enough it is all there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

It includes music outside of PM, which is understandable, but there should be a PM downloaded music only filter. Also, when Fb Messenger dings, it lowers the sound of the music, so when my friends are going nuts, it goes in and out continously. Haven't found a way to keep that from happening in either app. Other than that, I really like PM."

Kind of ironic to say but the *searches* are terrible, the way it sorts out the music is not intuitive and it takes too much time to load a simple song. The catalog is worse than Spotify's or Apple's; even Tidal has a better interface. And it forces you to compare since it doesn't have any community-oriented program or information that gives any value to the service on its own."

I'm constantly accidentally removing songs from my playlist  because I don't swipe perfectly up or down. Sometimes if I'm just tapping a  song without looking, it will remove the song, and I don't even know that I  did it. I probably have lost 20-30 good songs and don't even know it, and  will never find them again, because of this horrible design choice, that I  know you guys hear our complaints about, but refuse to fix. Good lord, how  could something so simple be so hard to fix. Give me an option, a check in  the box or anything to enable the feature or disable it. If I can write  this big of a complaint about this one flaw, then that might give you an  idea of how frustrating this is for an end user.  Edit: It has been over a year now and this simple feature still does not exist, it's regrettable that this app has been thrown in the rubbish been by Google now so that it can focus on YouTube music instead.
