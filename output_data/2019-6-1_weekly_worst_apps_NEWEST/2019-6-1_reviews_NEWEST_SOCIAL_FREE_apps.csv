It's true that they need to protect their customers data, but it doesn't mean they need to be an all knowing big brother either. They shouldn't lock their customers up for days just because they logged in from an unusual location, from a shared device, or because they tried to use VPN to login. What they need to fix is their API, that's how the data is leaked."

"Facebook","A Google User","June 1, 2019",1,"This app has gotten progressively worse over the years. And lately it is 
simply a horrendous experience. It's slow, takes ages to refresh and takes 
ages to display notifications, won't play video clips correctly. Don't be 
fooled by the 5 star ratings you first see... Click on all reviews and see. 
Frankly it has become such a nightmare that I'm starting to avoid using it. 
But, if you want to use Facebook you have no other option than this, so 
suck it up or quit the book I guess."

Why couldn't they just have put ads between friends' stories and called it good? Discovery used to be decent, but now it's just toxic, clickbaity garbage. Not to mention that Instagram copied stories and did it 10x better, with interactive content and links to other apps. I only use this app because I don't have any other alternatives, and that's a very, very bad thing."

Maybe someone complained that they preferred separate notifications but for spam-sake, I prefer 1 single notification. If possible maybe provide a setting to switch between"

But the point of the application is to take pictures and record videos. The only phone that seems it to use the Camera API on is Google Pixel devices. My friend's galaxy S10 looks a bit better and I have the OnePlus 7 Pro this camera is pretty good. But when I take pictures on Snapchat or record video it is HORRIBLE. the quality is dropped so bad like why?.."

This causes extremely bad quality pictures that are zoomed quite far in. And we still can't do landscape text. They're ""redesign"" apparently did nothing useful. In other words, this app still can't perform basic operations. Stop skimping on the Android version and just make this app properly, like how almost every other app is designed for Android."

It's true that they need to protect their customers data, but it doesn't mean they need to be an all knowing big brother either. They shouldn't lock their customers up for days just because they logged in from an unusual location, from a shared device, or because they tried to use VPN to login. What they need to fix is their API, that's how the data is leaked."
