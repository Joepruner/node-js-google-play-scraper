The issue I'm having is that it all of a sudden wouldnt respond and said there was no network to connect to. I was connected but thought I should just delete and redownload. Nothing. I logged out and it kept me logged out for a day even though the login details were correct. I finally logged back in today but all of my scenes are missing. Any way I can get those scenes back?I'll change the rating if I get help",
