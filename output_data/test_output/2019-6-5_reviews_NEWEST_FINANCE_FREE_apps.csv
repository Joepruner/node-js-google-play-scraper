"Chase Mobile","Bob Boyer","June 5, 2019",5,"Great app! Easy to use. One request- it would be awesome if there was a a way to place a pending payment in the app. For instance, say you wrote a check and the payment has been paid, you could go in and enter the payment, it would show pending and would reflect in your available balance. this would be a nice reminder not to spend what you dont have. BC who keeps check ledgers?"
