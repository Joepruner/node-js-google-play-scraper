The previews on some of the items don't show up so you don't know what you're getting until you ""purchase"" it. these are the items that are kinda glitchy when you try to use them so I'm guessing the two issues are related. all in all it's a pretty cool app. can't wait to see what else the developers do with it!"

"Magic Poser","ART_AND_DESIGN","Sarah Mach","April 19, 2019",4,"Good app, much less paywalled content than easyposer. however, the amount of content and customization of the figures is still lacking- as long as the developer continues to add more content regularly that shouldn't be an issue. I definitely recommend the app, fully functional and good value. looking forward to see how it's improved in the future."
"Magic Poser","ART_AND_DESIGN","Cherri Fizz","April 18, 2019",4,"pretty nice app. it's cool to see an app that rivals easyposer. one of the features this has that easy poser doesn't have is that you can drag limbs. it makes it way easier to pose that way, thank you! my only complaint is kind of a nitpick, but I hate how slow it takes to drag the screen and move the perspective around if you could add an option to adjust the camera sensitivity, that would be great! thank you!"

I just have a few minor suggestions. can I perhaps maybe mal it so that when you draw, the lines appear a bit more straight when u draw, on it phone for example, cuz when I do it the lines always wiggle a little. also can u also perhaps make it so that the animations can link to ur account so when you for example uninstall the app their still there when you download it again."
"FlipaClip: Cartoon animation","ART_AND_DESIGN","DoubleBunny","June 12, 2019",4,"good app (acquired use) this app is great. however for more ambitious animations (especially if you are placing single frames for long periods of time for a story board like layout) it makes it very hard to copy and past across multiple frames. the only thing I have a issue with is to know how much more convenient it would be if you could copy a single frame and paste it OVER existing frames (in frame viewer) rather then being given the option to create a new frame with the copied contents."

One of the many bugs is when trying to save a lately edited sketch it duplicates that sketch and that occurs a lot. Another bug is that when trying to move a layer it sometimes doesn't want to move or makes the layer above/under vanish, this happens when you try to move it using the layer menu. There are probably more bugs but i still didn't see them, i'll keep you updated."

However, recently I've been experiencing some problems. When I'm working on a drawing, it tends to crash. A lot. It wouldn't be a problem but the progress I've made in my work would then be deleted. I didn't think much of it when it first began but now it's happening more frequently. In addition, I'm sure my devices aren't the problem. It happens on both my phone and tablet."

I have a Sony Xperia Z4 running Android 7.0, and I could not get half the functions to work. It was not my stylus pen either.

There should be a feature where you can view and compare layers in full screen/size 3. Water tool (like in other software) 4. Free and offline use of paper textures 5.

I love the finished results, and how you can add as many layers you want. However, there are a few slightly annoying problems which are mostly harmless: whenever erasing a part sometimes another layer will move around on its own. Also, the select tool is pretty frustrating, like before, sometimes another layer gets selected instead of the one you want to choose. But overall, amazing. And, it's free!!!"

Meaning that it deletes most of your designs unless you use alternatives that work on both versions of the app. I hope you see this because I have wanted to use Canva more on both versions but this restriction stops this. :)"

I think it's stupid that you have to buy any of the main features to actually get any good content from this app. I don't like how slow it runs when you try to zoom in, zoom out, or move it. The app is slow, and I think it could improved greatly. I know you're probably not going to stop and look at my single review, but maybe you could just make minor changes so the app can be better and not dissapoint people.

I'll try fixing my files myself again, but a look into a fix for this would be greatly appreciated. The app also asks me to sign in every time I open it now, though this may just be a device issue."

In response to your question: the ease of use and intuitive interface. Not needing to click on multiple things to get to what I want. Also, retaining all the filters I already purchased if I am transferring to Spark Post.   The main issue you are NOT seeing is that many of us used it as a photo editor, not a graphic design app. And this is not what can be done as quickly in Spark (despite the name). With Aviary, one could take a photo, edit it and post it in under 2 minutes. Spark is cumbersome (like all Adobe software), with multiple menus, sub-menus, and sub-sub menus. OK on a laptop. NOT OK for a mobile."

"MediBang Paint - Make Art !","ART_AND_DESIGN","Haizuru Ishida","June 14, 2019",4,"MediBang is a good art app with quite a splendid brush engine. It is, however, very limited in colour adjustment options, like tone curve and color balance. Contrast and Brightness are nonexistent here and the app would really shine, with the addition of these features. Hue, Sat. and Brightness aren't enough and still leave the art looking faded... compared to another program i use (although watercolour doesn't work well there so, MediBang). Please consider adding these. Thank you."

To use as a model so u can figure out a pose. Not to help you DRAW. But instead to help u REFERENCE. Jeez. App is 10 out of 10. Definately worth the money and worth it having it free. Great app!

In order to see all the songs/artists you've saved, you have to go to ALL THE SONGS YOU SAVED and organize it by artist. They had separate tabs for different ways to listen to music instead of just smashing it all in one tab. You also can't view what you've recently listened."

The way I use Spotify has been significantly disrupted by this change. That was how I kept my high rotation going. The album view on the home tab is short and unwieldy. I feel this, along with the other library changes, signals that Spotify wants to make their app more of a radio/track-focused platform at the expense of album listeners.

I have uninstalled this version & the fb app. I am trying the fb & messenger lite. When I click uninstall it says it's uninstalling but then it shows it as installed again. Every time I post on fb or send a message it shows up on one but not the other. Usually. Sometimes I log in on one & it takes me to the other. It will even show my message on opposite one but not on the one I was using when I posted."

That way, your phone's processor, battery, and internet usage wouldn't go through the roof and make the phone useless."

They are claiming it is due to licensing restrictions but I'm not buying that. It is unethical to charge your customers for a service claiming unlimited skips and then not fulfill that service. Also won't allow you to go back to a song that's been played. Will be switching to another service"

But I really wish they would stop associating me with things that are relevant to my Ex-husband. And the abortion clinic commercial HAS to be the WORST! Abortion is sick in 99.9% of situations, its murder for selfish reasons in 99.9% of situations and I find it highly offensive that Pandora forces me to listen to a commerical about an abortion clinic."
"Pandora - Streaming Music & Podcasts","MUSIC_AND_AUDIO","Valerie Longobardi","June 17, 2019",4,"Not too shabby for a free music app. My only reason for withholding the fifth star is that commercials have a tendency to play right in the middle of a song or track that I'm listening to. Otherwise, I have had no issue with buffering unless it has to do with my internet, and the clarity is pretty good even with my horrible speaker on my phone. Update the app so that it doesn't interrupt my song, and you'll have my fifth star."

All I can do is close the app and reopen it, which is annoying."

The new update is very confusing and inconvenient.The artists aren't in alphabetical order and I can't see my last played artists as easily as before. Everytime I go on my library and click on an artist or an album the whole app crashes down. Please take care of the matter."

It will get 5 stars when they get the same program as Pandora which has your music stop playing when Bluetooth streaming is interrupted. I also don't like when you are doing a music or artist search if you don't spell absolutely correct it won't even give you good suggestions as to what you may be looking for. Fix those and a 5 star will be completed. üòé"

My entire music library has been dumped in a single playlist with thousands of songs. For an album to appear in the Albums tab you have to save the entire thing, even if you only want one song from it. Artists have to be followed rather than just saving the songs you actually want to listen to. Will be switching to another service if this update isn't undone."

However, there was a recent update that changed the ""liked songs"" playlist. Now if you turn on shuffle and manually tap a song in the playlist it will turn off shuffle. For new people this probably isn't a problem, but for someone who has been using this as their main playlist it is kind of irritating. Now I'm forced to make a new playlist with all of these songs just to be able to keep shuffle on."

App is 100% dependant on Wi-Fi, and so often reminds me of Skippy CD players from back in the day, constantly stuttering as it struggles to play one song."

"Pandora - Streaming Music & Podcasts","MUSIC_AND_AUDIO","Valerie Longobardi","June 17, 2019",4,"Not too shabby for a free music app. My only reason for withholding the fifth star is that commercials have a tendency to play right in the middle of a song or track that I'm listening to.

Love a certain band that you want to hear more often? Add said band to the station! Overall, Pandora is worth it. Even more so than it was last year! Good job, Pandora team!"

But, this seems to be one of the tactics that a lot of your drivers are using nowadays. How is it that the trip is cancelled and I get picked up by the same driver ? Now i have a cancellation fee and a fare ! You're going by the way of cab drivers, who would figure out ways to enlarge the fare. Looks like I'm going to have to find an alternative."

As I am writing I am waiting for a uber that will be arriving in 25 minutes and I had asked for it about 10 minutes ago. I think the best solution would be to ask the passenger if they are willing to wait. I could've taken the bus. Now I can't cancel because the fee would be 5 dollars and I would still have to order a Lyft. Update: Cancelled cause then it showed that the driver would arrive in 30 minutes. -.-"
