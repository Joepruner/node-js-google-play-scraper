"Duolingo: Learn Languages Free","Evan Herbert","June 5, 2019",2,"Most recent update seems to have removed all the grammar/info sections from the lesson (at least in Japanese for english speakers). Previously when you tapped a lesson, a popup came up with a start button below which would start the quiz and 2 buttons top right. One to let you skip the level with a difficult quiz, the other which actually led you to a page that taught you the material of the lesson e.g. grammar, alphabet etc. This latter button has now disappeared in the latest upate!"
