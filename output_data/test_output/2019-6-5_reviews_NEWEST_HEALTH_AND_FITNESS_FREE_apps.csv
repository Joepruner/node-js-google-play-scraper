I'm so sick of it, but I haven't found another app yet that has the same set up & I hate that I'm gonna lose all my progress switching to a different app. if you wanna keep all your progress don't use this one. they can't keep up with it. it's very frustrating to use when it's messing up all the time. I type something into my food diary & it logs in the food about 30 times so I have to go through it & delete the other 29 entries. you scan something & it goes nuts.üò°"

"Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal","ANGELwulf","June 5, 2019",1,"Every few months the app will not sync with the server or my Fitbit. I've tried uninstalling the app and logging out of my online account. When I do this, my ENTIRE account is wiped out and all my food and activity logs are permanently erased. Months of tracking and hard work are gone. Seriously not impressed."
"Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal","Dawn Beaumont","June 5, 2019",5,"I only have the app, I dont pay for the premium package but it is still really useful. I am just trying to get back on a healthier eating lifestyle . (Fell off the wagon a bit )!!! I've been reading up on macros etc. The app will count them for you as you add your daily foods. It will also scan the barcodes and give you the info. then you can just adjust quantities if necessary. Then you can build up a list for future reference. Works well for my needs. You can also pair it, eg. to a fitbit."

"Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal","Devon McCauley","June 5, 2019",3,"Usually this app works very well, but for the last few days, it won't seem to sync with my Fitbit, giving me credit for my excercise there. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I have unlinked the two from one another and waited 15-20 minutes before relinking them back together. It gave me credit for my excercise but only for the 8k steps I had walked that morning, not the total 13.5k steps that I had. Zero excercise is what it said. Logged my oatmeal 10x this morning. Update available?"
